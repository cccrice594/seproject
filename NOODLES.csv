review
"During a business trip late last summer, we dined at Noodles in the Bellagio and were more than pleasantly surprised. From outside appearances, our expectations were actually quite low.  Here is yet another valuable lesson in not judging books by their cover. After a short wait for seating, we received extremely courteous service and exemplary authentic Asian Rim food made fresh to order; none of that prefabricated Americanized stuff. We’ve enjoyed some stellar Asian cuisine around the country, especially in several different China Towns over the years. This food at Noodles was actually comparable, and in some ways better. Our next trip to Vegas will definitely include another delicious meal at Noodles."
"Located inside Bellagio Hotel in Vegas, this restaurant has a nice ambience and it's suitable for family dining. Though it was a long line up and wait time to get a table as reservations can't be made, the service was great and fast. My son who's very particular and picky about food, enjoyed the noodles and dumplings. Most nice restaurants in Ceaser's Palace and Bellagio close at 10, but this opens until late."
"In a city where a cocktail can cost $20 it's to find a spot that isn't trying to gauge your wallet. My friend and I shared the $30 price fix meal at Nooles and with a choice of soup, appetizer and entree, it was plenty for both. The small restaurant is lovely and quiet and the food was delicious. I can imagine there might be a lengthy wait during busy travel times but we only waited a few minutes."
The beef noodle dish really was tasteless. The shrimp pad thai was good. Tables very close together - so much so that when the table next to us was served I got bumped on 3 separate occasions by the waitress. Cant have a conversation with out the table both sides hearing. It needs 1 less table on the 2 seaters and more space. Really disappointed with the taste of the food.
"The Bellagio is host to some very impressive restaurants with some very expensive bill tabs, but Noodles is a great little restaurant near the casino entrance. The staff are friendly and efficient. The menu has plenty to choose from and the food is delicious."
"We stayed in another hotel but was at this casino to play lots and ran into Noodles on accident.  Good option of Asian food available and the food was amazing.  We had an order or fried pot stickers, mini egg rolls, Thai iced tea, and friend chicken rice.  Everything was delicious and far too much food for my husband and I to finish ourselves.  We were in Vegas for 4 1/2 days a date there twice because it was so good!  Beware, pricey but everything on the strip is 50-75 dollars for a two person meal."
"We stayed in the Bellagio and only for the one night, so we picked a restaurant there that would be good for the whole family.  Noodles is what we chose and what a mistake that was.  The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is that some of the food at our table was pretty good like the Hong Kong noodles and my daughter's shrimp wonton soup.  I ordered Malaysian fried rice and it was not different than regular fried rice and didn't seem to be what the menu described.  I am pretty sure I was given regular fried rice.  The service was absolutely awful.  The main problem is that I felt we were at a cafeteria ordering food.  We placed our orders to include 3 different appetizers, and then 4 meals (one for each of us).  However, we received 1 appetizer and then immediately following, 2 of the 4 meals.  We were a bit confused.  We were hungry so we just started with the appetizer.  We would have just told our waited to forget the other two appetizers at that point, but we literally didn't see him for like 15 minutes when he brought out the two remaining appetizers and 1 of our other meals.  We asked at that point where the 4th meal was and he said it was on its way.  Likely another 10 minutes transpired and then my daughter received her food.  We were all pretty much done at that point. The waiter was basically never seen and didn't seem to care that our food was totally messed up.  I was just completely appalled.  They were not overly busy in any way.  The assistant was awesome in always keeping our drinks filled.  But for a $160 check, I would have rather just had fast food in our room."
"We've been eating at Noodles for many years and even during a global pandemic, they do not disappoint! Their food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. The staff are always extremely polite and welcoming. This is a must-do for us anytime we are staying in Vegas or even passing through."
"They have the advantage of being one of the only places open during the week at Bellagio.  With almost everything closed during the week, they have a monopoly on the joint!

This monopoly hasn't affected the quality of the food though.  The service can be hit or miss, we went twice on our last stay, service was great one time and horrible the other. 

They have a great variety of noodle dishes, as well as other common favorites.  The Pho and Beef Satay were excellent.  Don't be afraid to order a cocktail while you are there, they are mad at the bar located just outside the restaurant.  I can take a bit of time to get them though!!

All in all, I'd certainly go back if I was staying in the hotel, but not a place I'd make a dedicated trip to.  Too many other great options in Vegas for noodles."
"On our recent visit to Las Vegas, we had the pleasure of dining at Noodles Restaurant at the Bellagio.

For dinner on November 6, 2023, and November 7, 2023 we made reservations.  Both times we were seated immediately.  On November 9, 2023 for lunch, we did not have reservations but were seated immediately.

Each time we had a table that was convenient for a wheelchair.

Staff were friendly and professional.  They gave us an appropriate amount of time to review the menu, and were available to answer questions.  The service, on all three of our visits, was impeccable.

Our food was perfect.  The presentation was pleasing.  The temperature was perfect.  The spicing was to our taste.

We recommend each of the dishes we had.  Mongolian beef, Pad Thai barbecue pork, Pad Thai beef, Hor Fun black bean sauce chicken, Yaki Udon barbecue pork, and Yaki Udon beef.

The pricing was reasonable for the quality of the food, portion size, service, location and ambiance."
"We used to go here years ago and loved this place. We stopped by couple of days ago during our Christmas vacation, and it  was a completely disappointed.
The server was so rude and the service was so bad. This restaurant is charging premium for food that tastes was so terrible.  Please stay away with dishes that we ordered.
1. Dory fillet with ginger and onions
* This one is so salty, greasy and smelt so bad. And its cost  $32.88 

2. XO CRABMEAT VERMICELLI
* Vermicelli was so dry and no taste. There was a tiny crabmeat in this dish that they called XO CRABMEAT. This one cost $30.88

My suggestion for you is stay away with this restaurant.
Expensive, Greasy (need to say it few times), taste meh, terrible customer service."
wife and I had a snack one night and liked it very much. The place was packed. We order a simple beef and flat noodles dish and shared it. My wife is not a huge asian good fan and loved it.
"What a disappointment.  I thought the Bellagio would have higher standards.  We ordered the egg rolls, Malaysian roti with curry sauce and chow Fun noodles with beef in oyster sauce.   For the egg rolls they could have come out  of any freezer case from a grocery store.  There was nothing distinctive about the filling or flavor.  The roti was a bit oily however the sauce was not Malaysian.  For one thing, for Malaysian food the curry is supposed to be yellow, not the orange colored.  It was gritty and nothing like Malaysian.  The chow fun the noodles were stuck together in big wads.  Clearly the chef did not separate them before the hot water.  For a restaurant named noodles, they were very sad.  I don't know what oyster sauce they used but it was of the lowest quality and totally lacking in flavor.  No amount of hot or soy sauce could save it.  When they waiter asked how the dinner was we told him the above and he took the chow fun off our bill.  Sadly, overall, Panda Express could kick their asses.  Don't eat here."
"the food is okay, nothing special. but we experienced the rudest bartender i’ve ever come across unfortunately. our server was so lovely but wow i can’t believe they have someone working there who is that offensive! our server even told us that he was a problem! super disappointing, thankfully i live in canada and rarely have to deal with people like that so that’s why it stuck out to my friends and i so much on our trip. would skip this place honestly, there are so many amazing restaurants in vegas, if you went to panda express you would basically have the same experience."
"We ordered the duck, broccoli with oyster sauce, crispy orange chicken and pork fried rice.  The meal was served hot and was good - not great.  The tables are close and it is noisy.  The service was good."
"I decided to try this restaurant for take away since I was staying at the Bellagio. Firstly, the hostess seemed visibly overwhelmed and stressed out so she was a bit frazzled and short when speaking with customers (maybe she is inexperienced with working at a busy restaurant?). I was excited to try the food, but was left disappointed when I started to eat and found that the chicken wings and oriental rice were EXTREMELY salty. I wasn’t expecting that at all; and I’m definitely someone who appreciates flavored food. However, the over salty taste made it very difficult to enjoy the meal. I was quiet disappointed and really wish the food was prepared better."
"I have been eating here for 20 years. it's no longer any good. The food is very dumbed down now and the prices are crazy high. if you order take out they give you one cheap set of plastic silverware even if you order for 8 people. They won't even provide soy sauce.
Very cheap quality--very high prices!"
"Lovely restaurant right off the casino floor at the Bellagio. Large menu, yet each item is distinct and carefully chosen. We ordered a large variety of appetizers and entrees and every dish was delicious. The servers are also quite kind and patient when you ask questions. As a bonus, there is a great cocktail menu. Don’t miss this!
The restaurant is very pretty and serene, yet buzzing at the same time.
I would return in a heartbeat!"
"The first night I had a waitress make me up a dish that was just plain sauce, beef, and vegetables. It was delish. The second night I ordered the confusing Kung poa dish with different meat that you could choose.  It was a dried up salty nasty mess. First dish delicious, second dish disgusting. Worse than old food court food."
"One remarkable exception to the polished hospitality offerings throughout the Bellagio Hotel in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, Noodles is clearly a ""miss"". Just off the main gaming floor it offers a wide variety of  asian dishes at reasonable (even for Vegas) prices. 

 We had a dinner reservation and were seated immediately in the midst of a brightly lit, hurry/scurry atmosphere. The table top was filthy. It obviously had not been serviced since the previous customer departed. We called this to the attention of the host who immediately summoned a bus boy to clean it. Instead we opted to be reseated across the aisle, and were accommodated immediately.

 Upon making the move we both encountered a sticky linoleum floor, which further added to our concern. And that table top, too, was filthy.  A  customer at an adjoining table opined that they also had exactly the same experience.

We decided that the front of the house issues could well portend a similarly unacceptable scenario in the  kitchen etc.  We left. So we offer no commentary on the food or service. We didn't stay nor will we be back."
"We stopped at Noodles for an early lunch during our recent stay at the Bellagio. The restaurant offers a very large selection of Asian noodle dishes. We started our meal with the vegetable tempura appetizer. It was cooked well and was a good start to the meal. I ordered the Spicy Thai Shrimp soup and my son ordered the Noodle soup with soya chicken. Both soups were enjoyable and were definitely a full meal. The Thai soup was flavorful, spicy and loaded with noodles. 

The restaurant is quite small but is very nice. I would probably recommend making a reservation if you want to eat here. The prices were reasonable and the service was efficient and polite. I would recommend this restaurant for a casual meal and we will definitely be returning to try some of the other offerings on the menu."
"Decided to eat here during lunch since we were staying at the Bellagio. We were seated pretty quick and the seats were nice. We ordered the dumplings for an app and that tasted great. Wife ordered some noodle dish that was heavily coated with oil and sauce which I thought tasted amazing but was too filling for her. I had a seafood noodle soup that was insanely disappointing. There was probably no flavor at all for either the seafood or soup. 

Overall the service, seating, and atmosphere were nice but the food was just ok."
"We were beginning to despair of getting reasonable food at midrange prices in Las Vegas, until we found Noodles. Wonton soup maybe best I have had in hundreds of restaurants around the world. Portions are big. Returned next day, so we also tried Ramen and Singapore noodles. Both very decent. But Wonton Soup is memorable, hugh shrimp inside, nothing else."
"I have eaten at Noodles many many times over the past 25 years.  It is the place I go for Chinese comfort food - partially because I almost always stay at Bellagio (if I stayed at Wynn then Red 8 is equally good but somewhat different).  I could count on Noodles for consistently and my favorite dishes are its Cantonese Chow Mein (their noodles are totally unique - no other place has that great texture)and their Mandarin beef noodle soup (the best!).   I would given Noodles a 5 star rating in the more than 50 times I've eaten there over my lifetime.   And maybe it is unfair I am writing a review only after a ""not good"" experience.  But I was so unsatisfied with my lunch I had to pint it out.  Lunch was a ""3"", but I gave the overall rating a 4 because I did not want my last experience to dictate what could be the only rating I would post on them.  We were there when it opened at 11:00 am.  The hot dim sum was ""LUKEWARM"" - Sooo unpleasant!   We ordered choy sum with oyster sauce but they did not pour cooked oil over the greens (that is a basic thing to do when serving boiled greens otehrwise it is too dry and lacks flavor).  C;mon guys you gotta do better.   I do not know if there is a new head chef.   Luckilym both of my favorites (chow mean and Mandarin beef noodle) tasted as great as always."
"Made a reservation for lunch at Noodles this week. I  really enjoyed the wonton soup with shrimp dumplings, so hot and delicious! The plate of salt and pepper shrimp was a really huge portion of food and so good.  The service was truly exceptional,. Drinks constantly refilled, food delivered promptly, manager checked in a few times.  Really exceptional service thank you"
"We came in 30 mins before closing and were seated immediately.  The server was prompt and put in our order. The food came out lightening fast and was hot and delicious. This is an excellent. This is a great Change of pace as opposed to  the 5 Star , very expensive signature restaurants at Bellagio."
We really enjoyed the food at this restaurant. The waitress helped suggest items that we could make vegan. We had the Sweet and Spicy Noodles with Tofu and Kimchi. Everything was delicious and the service was wonderful! Thank you!
"Having lived for years in SE Asia, I LOVE noodle dishes.  So for lunch one day during our stay we came to Noodles here in the Bellagio Resort.  I ordered the noodle soup with pork, my wife had Chicken Satay with peanut sauce.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the broth...just not very rich, overall rather tasteless.  The peanut sauce for the satay was just average...again, lacking in taste.  The Thai Ice Tea was excellent.  Service was good, not exceptional, but the server checked on us once and our order was taken in a timely manner. Atmosphere was pleasant.   I don't think I will return as I think I can find better elsewhere."
"Visited in 2010, so, had to go back as the noodle dishes reminded me of time in Japan.  Noodle dishes are huge and had a hard time eating most of mine.  My husband had a hard time too.  I had one of the noodle dishes made with miso broth (vice chicken or beef).  Did not seem salty at the time, but, later, I noticed it was difficult to take off my rings.  Next time in Vegas, I will try to eat here again as it is great!"
This restaurant is more like a cafe and very casual but good Asian food and located in the Bellagio Hotel. We ordered edamame and fried rice for a snack and it came quickly and was very fresh. I would no t recommend dinner just because of the atmosphere but the food it above average.
"The food reminded me of food eaten while traveling in Asia years ago.  Very tasty.  I can't say anything we had was bad, but the service was not up to what I expected at the Bellagio.  No one was rude or anything, but I did feel rushed a bit, while at the same time, ignored a bit.  With that said, it is not a high end restaurant.  It is casual sit down establishment that doesn't require reservations weeks in advance and the dress is casual as well."
"Nice place but for a restaurant inside the Bellagio we expected better in terms of service especially. The waitress kept coming to take our order, without giving us time to choose. Hearty, decent dishes, very spicy for some, more bland for others. Bottle for €75 placed directly on the table, without ice bucket. Still with the fork in our mouth as the waitress wanted to take the dishes away from us. We therefore expressed our dissatisfaction by validating the minimum amount on the payment terminal when paying the bill."
Great authentic noodle dishes at this restaurant! We had Udon and Pad Thai and were very happy with the food and the service. This restaurant is tucked away in a quiet corner off of the casino floor. Make reservations because they were turning away people that didn’t have them. And this was at 10 pm on a week night.
"Everything was bland. I’m still sitting here at Noodles while I write this. We are a group of 5 and I recommend this to my family since it was great when I ate here July 2022.

The dimsum was cold - shrimp balls, shumai and pork buns.

The Pho, bbq pork noodle soups, oriental fried rice and shrimp egg noodles were so bland we had to douse them with fish sauce or soy sauce. The Mongolian beef didn’t have the hint of sweetness but at least it was tender.

I’m so embarrassed to have recommended this place."
Such a great pan Asian spot! The menu has a variety of pan Asian cuisines with the overarching theme of noodles. We arrived for lunch and were seated very quickly. Our order was also taken quite quickly with the food arriving in no time at all. Each dish was yummy. I will 100% return
First visit and we’ll be back. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was cozy. Our orders were very tasty. The fried rice needed a little more flavor. We thought it a little flat. Otherwise everything was fresh. .
"We ordered Pad Thai, a fairly common dish. The noodles were wide, sticking together, the sauce had no flavor and the chicken supposed to come with it almost inexistent. Worst meal we've had in a long time. Service was so so at best. Certainly don't recommend!!"
"I usually make one stop here on every trip for a bowl of soup.  Food is always good. Service is more like a fast food counter.  Take your order and bring your food,  No recommendations or checking back on you.  It seems no matter what time I come or how busy it is, they always sit me at the bar.  I know I am a single diner, but I would like a table sometimes. Great for late night bites since other restaurants are closed. Little pricey, but you are in the Bellagio hotel so I guess that is expected.  I will be back on my next trip."
Ate here with family and enjoyed our meal.  Everyone enjoyed the pad thai we shared.  The fried rice was a little plain so pass on that one.  The Chinese Mandarin can be adjusted for spiciness.  Worth a visit.
"It's inside the Bellagio, in a somewhat hidden location in the middle of the casino. Well decorated and comfortable house. We ordered tempura, yaki noodles and a Kung Po shrimp, as an option from the menu of the day. We found it to be OK overall, with reasonable service and the same prices."
"My family needed a restaurant for dinner before the Cirque show O at the Bellagio.  This restaurant is conveniently located in the hotel, and we were seated quickly.  Despite a big crowd, we didn't have to wait long for the food which was plentiful and tasty."
We had reservations at 5:00 on a Wednesday and there was small wait to get our table.  Service was good but the two dishes my wife and I had were just ok.  I had Singapore rice with chicken and my wife had the Cantonese duck.  A little pricey for what you got.  Just ok in our opinion and probably wouldn't spend the $80 with tip to go back.
"Restaurant was very over priced.  I had a bowl of soup with shrimp and noodles, taste was okay.  Soup and Tea was $29.  It only had about 4-5 shrimp.  This was a poor choice on my part, but everything else was too expensive.  Staff was great though and there was a little bit of a language barrier."
"Good atmosphere , most of staff very friendly. Suspect grumpy old guy that grunts and waves you off when asking ?'s is a helping uncle or some thing. Had sake, Hong Kong fried noodles and sea food pho. All good and reasonably priced.  Wife loved it. It was more safe, knew what i was getting, not a lets go out to eat fine dining kinda restaurant to me. Being grunted at and waved off when asking for water was funny though. Second person was very nice and took care of us."
My husband & I wanted something quick and not too filling for lunch so we ate here. I ate the Japanese Seafood Udon Soup. Very good! My husband ate the Kung Pao Shrimp which was spicy but good. We waited about 30 min to get in but well worth it. Service was fast. This place also excepts take out orders.
We are big dim sum fans and go to Noodles every time we go to Vegas.  The har gau is excellent.  We also like the Oriental fried rice.  Just a simple preparation but very tasty.
"Visited late afternoon when the place was fairly quiet as we were going out later. Service was good, sharp in fact, but the team did not seem the happiest bunch of campers. Food was, at this price, sadly average."
"We ate at Noodles for the first time during our latest stay.
WOW, the service was very quick, and the folks were very friendly. That alone makes for a nice experience, but the food was delicious, and the service was very quick. Definitely will be back!"
"We reserved in advance which was great because they were turning people away.  The food was SO flavourful.  Our waitress was lovely.  In Vegas terms, great value.  The only challenge was that we sat at the front of the restaurant, and the smoke from the casino was not particularly pleasant.  Nevertheless, we had a wonderful meal and were very glad we went."
