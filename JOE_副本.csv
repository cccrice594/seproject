review
"We fancied some dim sum so thought we would pay this restaurant a visit. It has moved from it’s previous location. At the time of our visit a liquor licence was pending. We ordered the soup dumplings (both pork and seafood), fried dumplings, scallion pancake and the egg plant with garlic and pork. We couldn’t finish it all. For me standout dish was the egg plant with garlic and pork – tasted exactly like what we used to get in China when we lived there. Nice to be served tea with your order. Staff were helpful. Gratuity is automatically added to the bill (15%). They only take cash. Worth a visit."
"The dumplings at Joe's are so great. All of the food is and you will love it. Joe's is in Chinatown, a must stop for any visitor while in New York City. The place can and will get packed as soon as it is up to full capacity again.

We were there in February, so I am not sure they are fully reopened, but don't worry, if not you can get take a way. Grubhub delivers and so do others.

The Pork meat soup dumplings are amazing and one bowl can fill you, so share, that you can try other items. Their rice is so good.

The place is not beautiful. It is just a big, and very functional room. It is worth the trip to Chinatown."
"We go there for the best soup dumplings around. Fortunately we got there just as they opened and didn’t have a wait for a table. Service was quick and attentive. No problems there. We also ordered a dish of vegetable lo mein that was fine but didn’t quite measure up to the soup dumplings. The good news is that their new location on Bowery is a shorter walk than their old location on Pell Street. In fact it seems bigger and nicer. Please note that they automatically add an 18 percent service charge to your bill. So check your bill before adding tip. Oh, by the time we left there was a line outside waiting to get in. A very popular place indeed."
"I ordered delivery today for the first time in a long time, and was reminded of why Joe's Shanghai has been around for so long. Everything was so delicious!  The pork soup dumplings arrived warm and fully intact and were amazing.  I also had 2 dishes I hadn't had before:  salted egg with sliced pork and mustard greens SOUP and braised tofu with minced pork over spinach, and wow!  YUMMY!  Prices are fair and everything was so tasty, I'll be ordering much more frequently going forward!"
"This restaurant was two doors down from the hotel where we were staying at. Really basic, feel good Chinese food. Definitely try the Szechuan Beef if you are a fan of spicy food. Only negative was that the service felt all over the place, keep in mind that this restaurant only accepts cash payments."
"PROS
Position, price is awesome and quantity of food is great. Awesome starters, it has to be underlined.

CONS
Service might improve - at entrance especially (40+ mins to get in), food so-so and “cash only” place (ATM inside with 4$ commission OR get there with money, uncommon in 2022 @NYC)

We had great expectations and they have been missed"
"My wife and I ate an early dinner here as it was next door to our hotel, we were so glad we did. This was the best Chinese food we have ever experienced, that includes what I have tried in China.  It was also the cheapest meal we had in New York.
The staff were very knowledgeable and extremely helpful in helping decide what we should order.
You cannot book for here you simply turn up and get a ticket number, we only waited approximately 15 minutes.  Don't be put off by the que outside as many are waiting for take away."
"I love the crab soup dumplings here, so much so that every time I try to make a trip here when I go to NYC.  Other favorites include the Shanghai noodles (but sometimes they can taste a little burnt) and the rice cakes.  Staff is what you would expect at a Chinese restaurant--not the friendliest, but I wouldn't say rude either."
"Long lines, endless waits, grouchy staff, bright lights, way too loud - but some of the best Chinese food in New York!
Try the delicious soup dumplings, Shanghai noodles, crispy beef and Peking Duck.
I put up with all the negatives for all the delicious food. Prices are good."
"I've been coming to Joe's for years. The new location is nice and fancy but sadly the same cannot be said about the food and service. They're going downhill in these two aspects. What was great about this place and what got them on the map was their food, while it is still good the quality is not the same as before. Service has never been their strength but now it's just terrible. Staff at the door should have better handling of customers for starters. Just waiting to be seated can be chaotic so you will need to be patient. The atmosphere is very frenetic inside so keep in mind that this is not a place where servers take their time with a customer or give personalized service. They will push you to get to order and eat quickly so if what your looking for is a place to have a pleasant meal Joe's isn't for you. I will still go back for their dumplings every now and then but I just feel that eating at Joe's has become uncomfortable."
"It's very popular,  a couple weeks ago, I saw Woody Allen go in with Rosemary's baby. Always a line outside.
the front desk ladies were very polite, very helpful,but, our waiter was surly, inattentive and forgot to bring (ala cart orderd)rice and hot tea of all things.

the dumplings were just ok, service was rushed, rude and not executed well with dropped orders for the basic fare! 
really dissapointed!"
"A party of 10, clearly tourists from uk, was t clear about size of dishes, waiter let us completely over order, no offer of help and advice, ended up with a large bill and more importantly wasting quite a bit of food.  

Very rude, no help and a place with no personality!!!"
"LOVE. First time here and I can't believe I haven't been here more often. We were worried that since there were no reservations there would be a wait but we went 5:30pm on a Wednesday and got in immediately. Others were waiting in line when we left though. 

MUST TRY: soup dumplings (we had the pork) and the scallion pancakes to start. Amazing. I could go there and just eat soup dumplings. Then we got a variety of noodles and fried rice. The portions were pretty big depending on the dish - some larger than others. We took leftovers to go. Delicious - go there. Lots of variety, quick service, so good.

Cash only! And the waiters did kind of stand around close by our tables."
"We got the pork/crab dumplings and they were very good. Worth a 30 minute wait? Probably not. For all the hype and notoriety I was left a little disappointed. The broth is very heavy chicken broth tasting and the dumplings are huge! We ordered a few servings and could barely finish one. 
Definitely not easy to eat and messy. Maybe instructions on how to eat would help the experience. We had soup dumplings at other places and know to open then then eat the whole thing, but impossible with that size. Would try something else next time for sure, most people seemed pleased and the prices are fair for how famous it is."
My significant other and I have traveled around the country trying out different XLB and this is the place in the U.S. to get serious dumplings!! Soup broth is absolutely amazing and we love the vinegar with pickled ginger. SO DARN GOOD! Their new location is beautiful as well. Love this place and can't wait to go back!
"We ate at Joe's because it was highly recommended by friends. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon. The waiting line was out the door. We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. The weather was warm and sunny, so we waited. And waited, and waited for well over75 minutes. 

By that point we were quite hungry and hangry. Well , the pork and crab dumplings were terrific
. But were they worth the wait.  I would say no. The main dishes we got were huge with each meal big enough for 2people, so we ordered too much food in our famished state. These dishes were also wonderful, but no meal is worth that amount of waiting. I would go again, but I would not wait that long for any food if I had known ahead of time."
If you like to spend a bit of time and enjoy delicious food then ask for a takeaway. Food great. No atmosphere. Food just pushed on to table. Aim is just to rush you. Starter arrived closely followed by main so we were still just eating the starter. Really impersonal. There's loads of competition so go there!
"The service was horrible. The waiters just sanded there and joke around without even look at the customer. There was no manager to look after and manage the business.  The soup dumpling was Ok but for other dishes,  they definitely cut comers. We ordered the Shanghai fly noodle;  there was very little meat and no shrimp at all. It was  full of MSG.  Be aware, they only take cash (possibly to avoid to pay income tax) , and force you to pay 18% tip which is already added  in your bill (hopefully  you do not look the bill, and pay them double of tip). Looks like they tried to out smart the customers."
"We had a late lunch/early dinner here before heading to the airport and the food was really good.  We shared Scallion Pancakes, Chicken with Black Mushrooms and a Whole Fish (minus the head) in a brown sauce.  All three were quite good and we would repeat all again."
Was my favorite Chinese when I lived in NY and it’s still great!  The soup dumplings are rich and savory. My favorite dish is shredded pork with dry bean curd and jalapeño. It’s got a great umami flavor and texture.
"We are not big Chinese food eaters but wanted to give it a try. I explained this to our waiter, who decided we would have the dumplings and pancake. Both were very good, and a new experience for us. My teens ordered the glazed chicken, which they loved. We ordered two dishes but only one arrived and it was too difficult to get the attention of the waiter to correct it, so they shared and it was plenty. We would go back, after watching a tutorial on the proper way to eat soup dumplings 🤣."
"Neat and Clean Chinese Food. Friendly staff with great customer service.
Reasonable prices for NYC.
You must try the Pork dumplings and Bean sauce mixed vegetables."
The crab and pork xiao long bao are sublime. Adding the vinegar is other worldly. We also got their wonton soup with shrimp and pork. The dumplings are huge and have whole shrimps in them. Very large portions and good prices made for an excellent meal. The sesame chicken was also top notch
"We had high expectations of the soup dumplings and food after reading reviews and seeing the long lines outside the restaurant. However, we were underwhelmed with the quality of the food. 

We ordered the famous soup dumplings. The dumpling skin was rather thick and not evenly cooked. We also had the vegetable dumplings and the dumpling skins were also rather thick and chewy. It also had corn which is not the traditional authentic ingredient for such dumplings. The wine chicken had a good dose of alcohol but the meat was rather tough. The Sichuan beef and beancurd was also average. 

We won’t be spending our calories here again. There are many other better eats around chinatown to indulge in."
"If you've ever been to din tai fung, Joe's will disappoint. But I fear din tai fung is the industry standard and everyone else is fighting for second. I can't speak to any of the dishes here other than the xiao long bao which Joe's is known for and the only dish I ordered. Xiao long bao are soup dumplings, one of only a handful of items I can order in Chinese and one of my favorite foods in life that I openly seek when traveling. The line is long; as in 45 minutes to an hour in off hours like 330pm. The soup dumplings are good, but they skin is too thick and the meat filling is under seasoned and the broth while maintaining a tastiness that coats your lips, lacks depth and richness in flavor. Worth a trip for locals, soup dumpling first timers or frequent NYC travelers."
"I've been coming here 20 years and it NEVER disappoints.  The soup dumplings ARE as good as they say.  I'm happy they moved to a bigger location. My only issues were the service (the wait system is archaic) and  the cash only policy (ATM machines in the front are pricey as hell), but other that the 1 hour wait was worth it and something I expected because it's a solid product that I'm always pleased with.  Crispy beef, lo mein and dumplings are a must try."
"Visited with a group from work and in spite of the website saying it serves vegetarian dishes, really it is very limited in this area. Most of the dishes in the ""Vegetable"" section of the menu included pork or crab or shrimp so I ended up with a plate of mushrooms and pak choi for $21. I had some very average vegetable dumplings but there are no veggie soup dumplings on the menu. The food was okay. The meat-eaters seemed satisfied and impressed but it was nothing special for me.  Chinese food is often not great for vegetarians but their website specifically says it serves vegetarian dishes so I expected more than this.  They take cash only but there is are 2 cash machines just inside the front door so that isn't really a problem."
"A tourist trap!   
I liked the old restaurant better.   It felt authentic.  Now it is just a tourist trap.   I paid over 100 dollars for over rated soup dumplings.   16 dumplings,  a plate of fried calamari, strings beans,  a bowl of rice and 3 beers.  The waiters were not attentive at all.   
And beware they even charge you with 18% tip, already included at the bill."
"I want the service charge from my dinner last night refunded. And I deserve interest and hazard pay. 

You did not earn a tip and shouldn’t be able to charge a service charge when service sucked. 

Service was terrible, staff were rude and poorly trained. No communication, literally snatching things off the table under our spoons. My God! You take my plate while I’m still chewing my last bite!?! What jerks!

Chairs were dirty. Literally there was a pea in the debris that I had to wipe off my seat.

The food was fine, nothing special, but the dining experience was horrendous.

We were seated in a terrible location, in the service area, at the top of the stairs to the restroom. I am not exaggerating that there was never a 10 second break without someone inches from our bumping into our table or actually leaning over us and our table. God I miss COVID social distancing after that claustrophobic experience. 

I want my money back. You did not earn a service charge. 
 
Shame on you for treating your guests like this."
"Must try their dim sum, a sensorial experience because they are filled with meat and broth, served with an excellent vinaigrette sauce.
The noodles with good meat, huge portions, at the end bring segments of orange to refresh the mouth. When you arrive they immediately serve fresh water with ice. Kind and professional.
We entered at 7pm on Saturday with practically no queue, but at the exit it was full of people waiting"
"Loved this place. We were seated quickly. Servers were very attentive. Service was fast. Food was delicious. We ordered the soup dumplings of course. They did not disappoint. We also ordered the crispy beef and a spicy prawn dish. Everything was really yummy. The restaurant is a tad pricey, but portion sizes were good. We weren’t able to finish everything. Will definitely be back on my next trip."

"Friends recomendered for us and it was espectacular!!
The food was exactly like we wanted to experience in Chinatown in NY"
We ordered take aways from Joe's . It was extremely disappointing and they got the order wrong . The food was not fresh . I will never order from Joe's again.
"Worth getting lost in Chinatown to eat here! After reading reviews and seeing the lineup outside, it must be one of the best restaurants ever! The pork  dumpling broth was so flavourful..I wish they opened up in Montreal!"
"The food is bland: salt pepper crispy duckling; spring roll; black mushrooms with bamboo, and jelly fish with sesame oil; the commonality seems to be a dull saline brine with some low rent seasoning. It’s very uneventful and pricey culinary, maybe try one of the smaller venues on the side streets, or north on Bowery."

Very ordinary- don’t know what the fuss is about - nicer atmosphere than their old location but the food doesn’t compete with any of the other Chinatown restaurants- soup dumplings used to be better - too doughy as we’re the sesame noodles which had no taste - only the Peking duck was good and not exceptional

"After three years pandemic came back our favorite restaurant joe’s Shanghai when we first met our first meal 1999 may 1 , new location everything food and service still amazing , we know John since 1999 very very friendly and kind, he really makes our dinner experience very Pleasant. Highly recommend “ crab meats soup dumpling”” Lion head meatballs” yummy yummy yummy"
"Anything and Everything is DELICIOUS. but the Dumplings take the title.    the best, I've tried several places and nothing compares to the textures the taste.    Absolutely mouth watering. I dream dumplings dancing in my belly."
"Visited with my wife. Food was good but experience was let down by rude, impatient and unhelpful staff and lack of atmosphere."
"A NY staple, Joe’s is the best place for soup dumplings in the city. Always crowded and there is usually a line, but it is worth the wait. The scallion pancakes and the crispy beef are wonderful choices too."
"I've been coming here 20 years and it NEVER disappoints.  The soup dumplings ARE as good as they say.  I'm happy they moved to a bigger location.

"The restaurant (located in Bowery) was recommended to us by a Chinese friend, and oh boy, did it not disappoint! We arrived late, 8:30pm on a Friday, and waited 30 min. It was pretty full. Make sure you get a ticket with the hostess, and hang around, they announce your number with a megaphone. The food selection is large and has mostly options for the “western” taste. We ordered the soup dumplings with crab and pork (hard to eat but yummy), the scallion pancakes and shared a lo mein main course. Enough for 2 people to eat. It was a really tasty meal! The orange slices they give you when you pay are a nice touch. I would definitely go back. They serve sake!
4 stars because it is cash only."
"Traveled from cleveland , waited an hour assuming people were waiting because it was good. Wrong terrible food , and staff was even more rude rushed us and then determined their tip should be 18% . Terrible way better food in Cleveland. Overrated."

"About forty years ago Joe worked in a restaurant in Rego Park, New York. He made great soup dumplings and very few people knew about it (also soup dumpling wasn't well known either). His wife told all her friends and the word got around and made him famous. Now that after forty years of fame and wealth, he is definitely slipping with his food. Maybe because of the mass production, the skin is way too thick. There are much better Xiao Long Bao out there with thinner skins.

Another phenomenon of this restaurant is that all dining room staff are very young and certainly lack of hospitalization training. I honestly don't know if Joe is still around to manage this business. Hope he's listening."

Take from somebody that lived in Shenzhen China. This please is excellent as far as their Shanghai cuisine is concerned. Service was also excellent even though it was busy and I was solo. Can't recommend Joe's enough!!! Make sure to order Tsingtao while your at it..
"This restaurant was two doors down from the hotel where we were staying at. Really basic, feel good Chinese food. Definitely try the Szechuan Beef if you are a fan of spicy food.

"I was esceptic about the reviews I saw from some other sources different than trip advisor, they wrote they have the very best Dumplings in NYC, OMG… they were right, the experience was amazing and more, the fried rice and the nuddles were just outstanding 😳😳😳😱😱😱"
"I ordered delivery today for the first time in a long time, and was reminded of why Joe's Shanghai has been around for so long. Everything was so delicious!  The pork soup dumplings arrived warm and fully intact and were amazing.  I also had 2 dishes I hadn't had before:  salted egg with sliced pork and mustard greens SOUP and braised tofu with minced pork over spinach, and wow!  YUMMY!  Prices are fair and everything was so tasty, I'll be ordering much more frequently going forward!"
Get the soup dumplings!!! Pork ones are where its at. We also tried the sesame chicken and that was great too. You really can't go wrong here.
"Good place, but you have to go before 12am because it’s all time full. Fast service, the food was good but simple with a correct price, for 2 persons 30 dollars."

"This is a must place when you visit China Town, if you really like dumplings. This restaurant is delicious. Very good service and ambience. The scallions pancakes are really good."
"The dumplings at Joe's are so great. All of the food is and you will love it. Joe's is in Chinatown, a must stop for any visitor while in New York City. The place can and will get packed as soon as it is up to full capacity again.

We were there in February, so I am not sure they are fully reopened, but don't worry, if not you can get take a way. Grubhub delivers and so do others.

The Pork meat soup dumplings are amazing and one bowl can fill you, so share, that you can try other items. Their rice is so good.

The place is not beautiful. It is just a big, and very functional room. It is worth the trip to Chinatown."
"In the year of the Chicken, I ordered the Sesame chicken. In my box of food was a surprise. The chef added fresh broccoli on the dish with a vinegar-soy sauce. It rounded the meal out very well!"
"When you think of nyc China town, soup dumplings, this is it. Say no more. Everyone will tell you— joes is the best! Expect to wait in line unless you’re smart like me and come here at 11 am as they open. :) if you’re not as smart, the wait is always worth it. In this crazy covid 19 stricken world, it’s important to support local. And this is, my friends, the best of the best local food in New York. I can’t wait to be back. If you’re traveling from afar- look no further! This has to be on your list."
"One of the BEST dumplings shop in New York!!! You can choose:Crab...choose Your favorite there, Only in JOE'S SHANGAI"
Nice meal but no liquor licence so we just had water hence a $25 meal for 2 of us including tip! Very clean and pleasant restaurant and we enjoyed our dumplings and noodles.
"We fancied some dim sum so thought we would pay this restaurant a visit. It has moved from it’s previous location. At the time of our visit a liquor licence was pending. We ordered the soup dumplings (both pork and seafood), fried dumplings, scallion pancake and the egg plant with garlic and pork. We couldn’t finish it all. For me standout dish was the egg plant with garlic and pork – tasted exactly like what we used to get in China when we lived there. Nice to be served tea with your order. Staff were helpful. Gratuity is automatically added to the bill (15%). They only take cash. Worth a visit."
"Even though the atmosphere is meh and chaotic, the Shanghai noodles and the soup dumplings are worth the wait."
"Lovely food. Amazing soup dumplings. And good noodle. Not alcoholic drinks. Cheap and tasty. If you can go around 4pm, before is crowd of people."
If you like to spend a bit of time and enjoy delicious food then ask for a takeaway. Food great. No atmosphere. Food just pushed on to table. Aim is just to rush you. Starter arrived closely followed by main so we were still just eating the starter. Really impersonal. There's loads of competition so go there!
very delicious of the Baozi; and the squid is even better. worth the waiting time of more than an hour. definitely will come again.
"I love the crab soup dumplings here, so much so that every time I try to make a trip here when I go to NYC.  Other favorites include the Shanghai noodles (but sometimes they can taste a little burnt) and the rice cakes.

"Long lines, endless waits, grouchy staff, bright lights, way too loud - but some of the best Chinese food in New York!
Try the delicious soup dumplings, Shanghai noodles, crispy beef and Peking Duck.
I put up with all the negatives for all the delicious food. Prices are good."
"Good pork soup dumplings. Very good prices. UsuLly a waitlisted that is ticketed. Good crispy beef. Skip the scallion pancake and spring roll, not very flavorful."
My significant other and I have traveled around the country trying out different XLB and this is the place in the U.S. to get serious dumplings!! Soup broth is absolutely amazing and we love the vinegar with pickled ginger. SO DARN GOOD! Their new location is beautiful as well. Love this place and can't wait to go back!
"Loved it! Service is on point and the food is fresh, delicious and doesn’t leave you feeling gross afterward. Sesame chicken is where it’s at!!"
"Joe's has recently moved just around the corner from its venerable old den on Pell Street.  Their new space on the Bowery is hip, spacious (for NY) and very attractive.  There were glitches, though.  The kitchen was a bit slower than it used to be.  One waiter kept trying to serve us dishes that belonged to the neighboring table.  The soup dumplings are still wonderful, and the wonton soup is well above average.  However, the Shanghai stir-fry noodles were a complete dud.  Although the dish looked very fresh and pretty, it completely lacked any flavor, in spite of being generously sauced.  I would be ashamed to serve something this flavorless to anyone. So it's not all wonderful, but this is still a very good place and I'm sure will improve still more as they work out the kinks in their new location."
"Is this place worth the long wait in line?! Are the soup dumplings that good?! Absolutely... this is the real deal and at such a deal. We ate it all. All was delicious and tasted homemade. Noodles, soup, dumplings and potstickers and the best scallion pancakes in town. Yum! Will return over and over again. Thank you Jon For being so gracious"
"We stayed in Bowery, and popped out for some food late afternoon. We had seen this place had great reviews so thought we would give it a try.  We absolutely LOVED it. We shared fried pork dumplings as an appetiser - these were really good. You get 8. We then shared General Tso fried chicken and fried rice. Both excellent and big enough portions to share. 

Loved this place and would recommend.

The only reason we give it 4 is you have to sit sooo close to other diners."
"The wait to get a table on the weekends can be a bit long, we waited about 50 mins, but its worth it. The pork soup dumplings are a must. The service was fast and friendly.you wont be disappointed"
"Just another Tourist as the Topic

- You should go to the restaurant before 5 pm, the queue was too long for me and it did not worth for waiting.
- The place was quite untidy, slowly organised the customers and tables. And if you want something private, please go to the other restaurants because you match in the same table with another customers.
- ""Xiaolongbao"" was very very very bad, too much contents of flour. The taste was nothing just some salty from the pork and crab in it.
- The other Chinese food were not Chinese food. They were modified too much and too sweet. The noodle please!!! do not order it, just sweet like a dessert . A lot of fusion food I ordered that day were very bad, too sweet!!!"
"Joe's Shanghai was always a reliable place for decent Shanghai food. Consistently good soup dumplings, adequate main dishes, satisfactory albeit rushed service.
Well, if you've been searching for their midtown or Pell Street location without success, that's because they've moved!
The cultish restaurant is now at 46 Bowery...Modern, bright, with an infusion of well-trained, friendly and helpful staff. Sure, there's still a wait to get in, but no longer a rush to have you leave!"
"The new location is wonderful -- a shorter wait than the old cramped quarters, cleaner bathrooms, and the same wonderful fare, fast if humorless service, perfect soup dumplings.
You need one tray of dumplings per person.  The beef with broccoli is great too."
"The wait was about 40 min. But it paid off when the food turned out to be really good. Worth the wait, but seating was awkward as you will share tables with strangers intimately in a tight space. The Sesame Chicken was phenomenal!"
Crab meat w pork meat soup dumplings are delicious! Portions are plentiful. There's not wifi. Payments are only by cash.
"We arrived at 8:20pm and told there would be a 25 minute wait. We were happy to wait given the restaurant had come highly recommended by friends. We wanted a table for 2 and were given a numbered ticket. It was a bit chaotic although the girl outside seemed to have it all under control. However a man and his partner turned up, got a ticket 8 numbers after ours, spoke to members of staff, winked and handed over money. Suddenly he and his girlfriend were offered a table before us!!!! Blatant bribery!
Eventually we were taken to a table and we enjoyed the pork dumplings, vegetable lo mein and the kung pao chicken. The food was nice and service was acceptable. Not amazing but not bad. We paid and left. The bribery we witnessed left a bad taste in my mouth that spoilt the rest of our experience. 
Worth visiting but not as amazing as we had hoped"
"You don't come for the service, you come for the food.
The service is all about speed - get you in, feed you quick.
Soup dumplings! Bizarre, but good. Portion sizes are big...I got the mu shu pork and that was EXCELLENT. You can't go wrong with food here . Just be prepared for it not to be a leisurely meal, and to eat with strangers."
"Not a large facility though there is an upstairs dining area. Tables on first level are tight together. I really wasn’t impressed with the waitstaff, not just mine but also noticing the cold, impersonal attitude displayed towards other customers in the restaurant. The fried pork spring rolls are excellent and the lobster ones are surprisingly good to. Shu Mai was great. The shrimp dumplings tasty wonderful however my issue with them is that the rice wrapping was way to sticky, it didn’t want to leave my chopsticks.  Be advised, they take cash here, sign at the door stating such.  Would I come here again, nah, probably go to another dim sum place around the corner on Doyers  Street."
"Authentic place were you sit with strangers on a big round table. Tea comes for free, food was really good. It‘s not a calm place, it‘s pretty hectical in there. But it‘s delicious and authentic!"
Worth the trip and any wait ... soup dumplings are amazing and the mei fun and fish was excellent! This was our second time here and it was so worth the trip!
The fast service and great fresh tasting food will blow your mind. I will be back for more. The only thing i did not like was that due to the limited amount of space they sit you in the same table with complete strangers and one have to listen to a complete strangers conversation.
"My friend had this place on the list to check out , so we came and had to see what the hype was about! There was a line , but it wasn't that bad. You just grab a number and chill in the area!

We got inside , it was packed and we were bunch with different groups of people in one table. I didn't have any issues with that , cause I came to see what all the noise was about! Prior to this we had already ate a bit , but we wanted to see what's so good about the xialongbao. We ordered xiaolongbao and another plate of noods. Honestly both plates were really good , I can see why people are making noise about xialongbao, It was very very juicy. Prob the most juiciest I've ever seen from a xiaolongbao! I personally really wouldn't wait in a line again for this place , just cause I'm not a super huge fan of xialongbaos. Overall experience was pretty cool though! 

*Be aware if there is a line , you might be seated next to another group!"
"Really enjoyed our lunch here!!  We had the best pork soup dumplings, the mu shu pork and General Tso's chicken.  All were delicious.  It's family dinning so if you don't have a big group you'll be sitting with other diners.  The staff are really on top of things and food comes out in a timely manner.  This is not a fancy place but the food is totally worthg it!!  Definitely recommend!!  We'll be back!!"
"Reputedly the best location for authentic soup dumplings. How do they make them? 
Great value. Cold Tsing Tao’s. The wait is worth the flavour, atmosphere and fast service."
"We could tell when we arrived and there were no Asian people waiting to get in, that the place would not be anything special.  It was crowded for sure, and the food was average.  Service was ok, but the server didn't smile or do anything to make the experience memorable.  It was close by to where we were at the time, raining and had gotten good TA reviews.  You can probably find a more tasty, and authentic experience elsewhere.  I agree with another reviewer that it is geared toward a USA/Euro crowd.  That's fine, but don't expect to be wowed."
"Most Tables are for 10 people we were placed in a table with 8  people, very tight and the plates were on top of each other. The restaurant and bathrooms were not clean.
I had a sea food plate in Brown sauce..It was over sauce the shrimp had no taste.
My wife had the Tofu in brown sauce.  Over sauced we have had better in most restaurants.."
"We have eaten Chinese food in China, Taiwan, and in dozens of excellent and authentic Chinese restaurants across North America and the world.  This is really bottom-of-the-barrel stuff engineered to be non-threatening to the Euro/USA crowd that filled the place when we were there.
The raved-about soup dumplings had thick skins and bland fillings.  Shredded turnip cakes were unexciting at best.  A platter of white cut chicken, a simple dish to make, was okay—but frankly mine is better.
There are so many really good Chinese places to eat in NYC, most especially for dumplings and other dim sum.  Don't waste either your time, money, or calories at this one."
"Our lunch consisted of crab with pork soup dumplings which tasted fairly good but not exceptional then we had crispy pepper skin duck which was tasty, double cooked pork which was nice but it was more cabbage than pork and chicken fried rice and one small beer , it was $75.07 including 15% service. The place is a little bit grubby and the toilets are not very good but it was ok."
"Friends recommended and I’m glad they did. We had soup dumplings, fried pork, duck, whole fish, soft shell crab and rice and noodles. It was all good except for the duck. Out of all of the food we ordered it came first (after the dumplings). I’m used to duck taking extra time, not being first. It was very dry. Everything else was very good!! The atmosphere is kind of crazy. It’s very packed with people sitting on top of you and bustling around. The service was excellent. I didn’t think it was expensive. Everyone in our group (9 of us) each paid $30 (that included tax and tip) and we were all stuffed to the gills. We had a great time and would love to return."
"Got the soup dumplings. No where near is good as Din Tai Fung (i really dislike how big the soup dumplings in america are), but it did the job. Also got the wonton soup. Lots of wontons but SO MUCH WRAPPER. What a doughy dinner. Really liked that it opened so late tho."
It isn't all hype... these are amazing dumplings!  Our entire meal was fantastic and would highly recommend.
"Always busy restaurant in Chinatown. We typically order soup dumplings, string beans and an entree like General Tso’s. The soup dumplings and string beans are a must.  Joes will be moving to a new location in the near future.  Just FYI."
"First time visiting Chinatown in a while so I scouted the web for some reliable options. Lots of reviews for Joe’s Shanghai so I stopped by. Food was decent but as I discovered over the next month, there are similar or better options in the neighborhood at lower price points. Joe’s is a good stop but there appears to be a tourist premium in the prices"
It was excellent from the soup dumplings to the tea. Everything we order was delicious. Only inconvenience was that we had to share a table and that was not too bad. The service was fast and all questions where answer.
"I really wanted to take my grandson here as he is a foodie and very efficient with chop sticks.  We started with soup dumplings and fried dumplings.  Both were wonderful.  The soup dumplings were definitely a favorite and full of flavor.  Our entrees were Jumbo prawns, which were ordered spicy and definitely didn't disappoint.  We also got Mei Fun and Chicken with plum sauce.  Both had lots of flavor.  Tea was good, but take advantage of the ginger soda.  So yummy!"
"There is a huge wait to get into this place.  I will start by saying that the ""soup dumplings"" were fantastic.  Probably the best I've had on the east coast.  However, the rest of the food was just ""OK"".  I also didn't understand the theme of the restaurant in terms of what type of Chinese food they consider to be their specialty. 

That said, it was a decent meal and service was good.  I'm just not sure it was worth waiting for 2 hours."
"Soup dumplings galore, prefer the crab.  Braised duck is good, as is spicy sliced beef.  Came with party of eight - 4 years old to 87 years old - all enjoyed meal."
"Long wait. Crowded. My double cooked pork was served to my neighbour, and I got his stir fried tofu and cabbage. My fried pork dumplings were only mediocre. But when I was shorted $10 when I got my change back, I finally had to say something! They apologized and provided the correct change."
"We tried this place on the recommendation of some friends.  Jumbo Prawns were awesome!  Chicken & Shrimp in plum sauce was also good.  Be aware that they only accept cash, which can be a problem if you do not know it.  Our bill was $75.00 for 2, and lucky we had that much with us as we usually like to use Visa on that big of a bill.
When you walk near the place, there is a person asking you how many and then give you a number on a piece of paper and everybody is standing outside as they call numbers for you to go inside to eat.  This was a Sunday night, and for 6 people, it was about 30 minute wait, longer for only 2 people in party."
"Recommended by many of the locals specifically for their dumpling soup but we just wanted a restaurant that set itself apart from a plethora of Chinese restaurant within the are. 
When we arrived, people were queuing to gain a reservation or to be seated so that gave us an inkling for how good the food was. Though extremely busy, the wait was short but clear that it could vary on a daily basis. 

You’re seated on large tables of 8 so you would not likely know the people sitting next to you. I have to admit the restaurant isn’t aesthetically pleasing-it’s very hall in the wall-and made me question our dining choices but once you see the dishes that are being sent to tables and and the aroma of smells, you are quickly reassured.

Service was quick, dishes were huge. I definitely recommend the chilli prawns (you can pay a little extra to have the shells taken off-I didn’t) and fried rice, which can be easily shared. The food was AMAZING!! 

Where we were seated, it had a wall showcasing the celebrities that had eaten there, which again solidified their status for the top 50 restaurants in Chinatown. 

I will definitely recommend Joe’s Shanghai to any family and friend who is going to NYC."
"The best xiao long bao you can find in NY, period. This is a hidden gem that has made the xiao long bao as their signature plate. Be careful when you eat it, you can easily burn yourself with the soup inside"
"A local friend took me here while on a business trip to NYC.  I tried soup dumplings for the first time and they were amazing!  Trying to learn the proper way to eat them was a bit of an experience in itself.  My friend said the other food was also great, but after two orders of the dumplings we were full.  They had a couple of options to choose from, but we went with the pork dumplings.  Great choice!

Seating in the restaurant was a little limited.  We went on a rainy day at a late afternoon hour so didn’t have too much of a problem, but I was told it is normally much busier.  Most of the tables seemed to be family-style so unless you have a full table with you, you may end up sharing with another party.  I thought that made it more fun!

The prices are very reasonable, but make sure to take cash as that is the only payment option."
"Small restaurant and very busy.   We are dumplings, beef and broccoli, chicken/shrimp in plum sauce, fried rice, and lo mein.    Everything was tasty!   Glad we stopped here. For planning purposes, the restaurant is cash only!"
"Great food and quick service. You get seated where there is space and may have to share a table with another group, but whatever your views on that don't let it stop you sampling this food. The Kung Po chicken is very tasty as are the soup dumplings."
"The evening we went it was packed with people outside. You get a number and there are chairs outside to sit on. The staff efficiently get people in and at a table, chances are you will be sitting with strangers. Strike-up a conversation, we did with a nice gent from Texas. Back to the food, we had Prawns in citrus and plum sauce shrimp and chicken. The Prawns were good but the sauce a bit bland. The plum sauce was better. The shrimp, prawns and chicken were all excellent - cooked just right."
"This is a super busy, small, sit with people you don't know type of place. All of those things would typically steer me away, but it was delicious!! The dumplings, the spicy beef, all of it, simply outstanding. I will definitely go back on my next visit to New York, even if you do have to sit with strangers."
Wonderful.  Amazing.  Deliciousnes.  Across the street from our hotel in Midtown.  What luck!  Loved the soup dumplings.  Couldn't get over them.  Loved also the beef lo mein.  We ate here twice in 4 days.  Highly recommend and it's Asian fusion in a delish way.
Joe's was a wonderful experience. There were several options and the food was well-made. The seasoning was great and the food was served in a timely manner. I will definitely return!
"You can tell from the queue and waiting time that this is a popular restaurant, further evidenced by the number of Chinese diners. The lady managing the queue was excellent but the serving staff were very indifferent and pushy to get you out as quickly as possible. Sharing a table with five other people is not my idea of fun either. Decor very dated and shabby. Toilets fairly revolting. However we were there for the food which was excellent."
We were told this had the best Chinese food around so we walked doe to Joe’s. There was a 30 min wait but the other restaurants across the street had no wait! We had a party of 4 so they seated us at a large round table with 2 other groups. It was no problem since they serve family style. The fried dumplings were great. Plus we had Generals chicken and shrimp w/ noodles. It was all good. They have a good selection of beer and the service was fast. If you are in China town stop by and see Joe. BTW- cash only.
"Let me just say that it’s worth the wait. Just walk in and ask for a number and wait outside. 25 min wait later and I had the best soup dumplings on earth. These little pillows of love broth are just the perfect combination of flavors, textures and smell are perfect. My all time favorite meal. Also had the scallion pancakes. A must in NYC"
"Love the experience. The best dumplings in NY and the scallions pancakes were awesome. The service was really good and fast. I must place to visit in China Town, NY, you won't be disappointed. I want to go back."
"Walking around China town in NEw York city my son and wife wanted to try one the restaurants in the area.  Boom looked on TripAdvisor for ideas, found a few spots but also asked a few of the locals in the area that were on Canal street. Everyone We asked said to go here, so that’s what we did.  Walking up to the street and saw another restaurant that had a ton of people waiting, we were interested in what they were serving so we walked over and looked at there menu.  U turn and went straight for Joe’s, the wait was 45 minutes Maybe a hour, you walk in and give your name to the person in the front and wait until they call your name.  It was hot as you know what and to be honest I am not a fan of Asian food but my vote was the minority and this is where we ended up.  Once our name was called we walked in, now I didn’t know what to expect walking in but I was kinda shocked as I saw the seating was family style, circle tables.  Taking my place at the table I looked at what people were ordering “dumplings”  I can’t say I have had a dumpling before but I will be trying them this time.  I swear everyone was eating and ordering them, I did get a side of fried rice with our dumplings along with some pot stickers and it was awesome.  My son and the wife told me they were the best dumplings they have ever had.  The service was quick and the bill came fast, CASH only    But if your short they have a ATM at the door.  I have to say if you have time please check this restaurant out, I learned how to eat dumplings and what an excellent dumpling tastes like."
"The place is very popular, the waiting time for us had been 45 minutes, very noisy place, with average services, they want you to order quickly, you feel pressure from service people. The price are ok, but consistent with Chinese restaurant."
"In the heart of seedy Chinatown, this place is brusque in service, and although has a great reputation and celebrity fan club, did not deliver on the day.
Dumplings were fantastic but soft crab and chicken in peanut was forgettable."
"ONLY negative here is that you have to expect to wait for a table...sometimes as long as an hour...so plan accordingly. Also unless you come with 6 or more people expect to share a table.  

This place is know for soup dumplings...if you have never had them google it...Theirs are simply the best.  Have had other good ones but never any better.

Also the fried rice cakes, which is nothing like it sounds...its basically small dumplings made from rice flour sauteed in a tasty brown sauce. Vegetable, beef, chicken or pork...all are good. 

Another stand out are the salt and pepper pork chops. Tasty with a crispy coating...served with salt and pepper mix, as well as a, sweet and sour sauce on the side for dipping.

VERY reasonably priced..the above three items had the two of us stuffed at $40 with tip included."
"I can’t visit NYC without a trip to Chinatown to have the soup dumplings 🥟 
Pork or pork and crab these are a must and will haunt me till I return again."
"A bit crowded and loud but great food. Our favorite the pancakes and the soup dumplings. The original location is much better than the 57th Street
You will not be hurried even when the line is out the door and down the sidewalk. 
Regular items we like are green beans, chicken with garlic sauce and Kung pao."
"Family style ordering for an amazing CT experience. Two styles of beef, the beef with jalapeños is light and and flavorful. The crispy shredded beef had a nice sweet range flavor at the end of each bite. Try the red bean cakes reminded me of a cross between a croissant with sweet red bean filling and a sesame crust bottom, loved it. Each dish was flavorful and impressive but the Singapore chow mai F was a little bland.  Over all definitely come here."
"The main reason I'm writing this review is in the hope the restaurant will take some heed and clean their facilities. Food was ok for what they charged, have had much nicer elsewhere. The restaurant was dirty with food stains on the wall beside our table and the toilets filthy. Wouldn't be inclined to venture back again or recommend.  

It was however very busy with lots of people arriving while we were there.

However, please give this place a deep clean, it looks like years since it's had one."
"I consider myself a regular at this point.  I used to have a go-to soup dumpling place in Chinatown that closed down, and when I found Joe’s, I was beyond happy.  Great place, fast service."
"Small, but nice restaurant. I have been here three times and enjoyed all three visits. Great dumplings. Good service. Can get crowded."
"It's noisy and, unless you're either lucky or sufficient in number to fill a table, you will share a table with other guests.
It's seriously noisy. However you're there to eat an,d the food is fabulous.
Service is ultra-efficient and it's great value.
Unless you really don't like Chinese food, you have to go whilst in New York."
"We read a few good reviews about the place.  But, those can be very misleading. The food was ok. I’ve had much better for the prices they charge. The service was AWFUL, the waiter didn’t bring one of our orders and then was arguing he did. Finally the dumplings arrived and he still was saying the duck she already had.  The place is small and packed with tables you can barely walk by and almost touching each other. I would never go back there and recommend not a good place to eat."
"Came twice in March and food is great. Almost every table you would see Soup dumplings. They are the best. We tried watercress tofu soup, fried noodles, beef and vegetable and they were all great. This one in downtown serves bigger portion and less expensive than the one in midtown."
"Been here few times. They have great reviews, but it’s going to be my last time. Food still tastes good but menu prices are going up so much. Services meh ok. So difficult to asked for rice, when you already ordered $100 worth of food. My server was NOT happy when we asked for more rice (only gave us 5 people to only shared one little bowl). Oh and also, if you don’t pay attention. There’s a small prints stating they will add automatic 15% service fee to your bill, regardless group sized! Don’t want to come back no more. Goodbye Joe’s Shanghai!!"
We shared a table with other travelers and had a great lunch visiting with them.  Our food was excellent also.
"We have tried to find better Xiao Long Bao in New York and California. We even tried other countries - even in Asia! But we keep coming back to this packed Chinatown restaurant for the thin, soft skin and abundant, decadent soup of their Xiao Long Bao. But be careful while consuming hot soup, even when enveloped in a thin dumpling shell - it can burn! It helps to put a dumpling on a spoon (Chinese spoon, mind you) and nibble it on the side first, slurp most of the hot soup next and finish the rest of the dumpling in one bite last. This process would allow you to enjoy the soup dumplings without making a scene (specially when you're sharing a table with people you don't know). We have tried other dishes, and they are mostly good. The fried rice cakes and other fried dishes come out with a good scent-of-the-wok, which is a sign of competent cooking.

The place is not small, but they do put a lot of tables in that space! Be prepared for a wait, or arrive 10 minutes before they open, to avoid waiting more than 10 minutes for a seat. It is cash only. And pay attention to your bill, as most likely the tip is already included in it - feel free to leave a few extra bucks if you feel that the service lived up to the food."
"We were recommended Joe’s China town restaurant by our hosts and weren’t disappointed.
The food and service are excellent together with the price (be aware cash only)! 
The two highlights for us were the dumplings (especially the soup dumplings) and the Szechuan Beef Casserole,  yum!
Will definitely go back next time we are in NYC."
We were recommended to this restaurant on our trip so of course we were going to try it!! It was so delicious. Everything was good. Nothing disappointed. After walking all day we were super hungry. It’s a bit tight in there but they make it work! It’s a must go if your in the area!
The soup dumplings were so good I was halfway through them before I remembered to take a photo!! The wait is worth it for these dumplings. Seriously the real deal of soup dumplings. Just be warned there will be a wait and unless your the last sitting of the night they will try to move you along pretty quickly once you’ve finished your meal.
"A friend recommended this restaurant to me and I had to check it out. The day I ate lunch here, the city was celebrating the Chinese New Year with parades, confetti cannons, and it was packed! Our name was it on a list and we were given a ticket with our number. We waited outside because the restaurant is small and cannot accommodate the number of people waiting. There were many! We were told 15 minute until we were seated but it was more like 40. Regardless, it was worth it! Service was fast. We had our crab/pork and pork dumplings in minutes. They were amazing! I look forward to returning!"
Absolutely amazing food we were seated quickly and our service was fantastic prices were reasonable & portions were large Will definitely return on our next trip to NYC
Anther place worth a visit when in NYC for dimsum - simple good dimsum joint that does not cost the earth.
"We stopped by Joe's Shanghai for a dumpling lunch.  It is a tight Chinatown restaurants, where they have shared tables.  It was quite busy at lunch.  We ordered both types of soup dumplings and the pork fried dumplings as well as a scallion pancake.  Everything was very good!"
"Late afternoon on a Sunday this place was packed, and it became evident why. The food was terrific, with spicy garlic eggplant and eggrolls and chicken lo mein - a great combo for two. All tables seat eight people so community dining is required. Given how overpacked the dining room was, The service was so fast it still boggles the mind.  If you find yourself in this section of town I highly, highly recommend this place !"
It’s all about soup dumplings and this place delivers.  Each one is crammed with soupy goodness and tasty filling.  My only complaints are tables being too close together even by NYC standards and being cash only.
Food was amazing and the prices are great. The portions are enormous and you want to try everything. Suggest eating there and getting something to go. Really fast service as well.
"Those soup dumplings.... Do yourself a favour and go.   The rest of the menu is on point as well, best food in china town."
"We’ve eaten in Chinese restaurants all over the world and this was by far one of the worst.  The food was mediocre at best but the service was awful.  Waiter seemed like he had no interest in answering questions about the menu and just plonked the plates down on the table and disappeared again when serving us.  Main came before we’d even finished starter and the soup dumplings were horrible.  Tasted like cheap meat inside and the whole restaurant has a dirty, run down feel about it.  To top it all, the bill was really expensive and they added a huge (undeserved!) service charge.  We had far nicer meals out elsewhere in New York for a fraction of the cost."
"Great soup dumplings!  Best place to eat them, tasty and the portions are big. Prices are great.  Always packed."
"We waited for an hour and fifteen minutes to eat Christmas dinner at Joe's, but it was worth the wait!!  Pan fried dumplings, moo shu pork and eggplant.  It was all great.  We did order sodas and never got them, but they weren't on the bill so no harm, no foul.  We ate at Joe's last time we were in NYC(56th street) and it was excellent.  We decided to try the original this time, and we actually had fun waiting for our table."
"Best place on the planet for soup dumplings! All of the food that we ordered was delicious, well seasoned and well prepared.  The portions were generous and we ordered off the appetizer menu. BE ADVISED: they only take cash but you won't need much. We had a party of four and could not finish all of our food for $60 including the mandatory gratuity. No credit cards but there is an ATM in the entrance. Be prepared to wait for a table and share your table with strangers. Do not confuse with Joe's Ginger, which is also on Pell street but not related."
"We're from the West Coast, so know Chinatown in L.A. and San Francisco, but wanted to have lunch in Chinatown in NYC.  Our tour guide took us right to Joe's on a narrow, crowded street.  The place is small, worn carpets, old tables, etc.  We were there about 2:00 pm and the place was still crowded with lunch time patrons, but we didn't wait more than 5 minutes or so.  It did take a few minutes to get some water, but once we ordered the food was there in good time.  There were 4 of us and we ordered about 5 dishes, beef with broccoli, kung pao beef, shrimp, chicken, fried rice, etc.  It was all good and lots of it.  We boxed up what was left and took it with us.  There was enough left over that the 4 of us had it that night for dinner in our hotel room.  If you want a fancy restaurant, with linen table cloths, go someplace else, but if you want really good Chinese food, go to Joe's in Chinatown.  The tables were clean, as was the silverware and plates.  We used the restrooms and they too were clean."
Walked all around Chinatown and came across this gem. The place was packed and we were seated at a large table with 2 other parties of 2 people. (If you want an intimate surroundings this is not the place. )At the suggestion of our dining mates we ordered the steam soup pork dumplings and Szechuan beef with bean sprouts. The portions were large and we were able to split these meal among the 2 of us. Lovely to have good food and company for dinner and reasonable. Quick service and no alcohol.
"In search of soup dumplings, a bartender told me about Joe's.  Decor is trashy and old.  Clean is not a word I would use to describe this place.  Wait staff ill-disguised contempt for you.  Utterly lacking in ambience, charm, and anything more than the basics in terms of sanitation. 

But those soup dumplings.  Terrific flavor, good (almost too big) size, bursting with flavor, good ratio of meat to dumpling, so much flavor....you get the picture.  

If the dumplings were even mediocre this place is a two at best.  But the dumplings are worth two more stars for sure.  And it's not too pricey."
"My new husband and I stopped in after we got married at the courthouse. It was packed already at noon in the middle of the week. We ordered some fried rice which was pretty average. To be expected. We also had some beef and broccoli which was also pretty good. Obviously the star of the show was the crab and pork soup dumplings. They were delicious and I had not had anything like it before. I live in Tampa, so there is basically nowhere else that I can get these bad boys. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the city though."
"We loved the food, the dumplings were really tasty and the portions were big! We enjoyed to be eating in a big table with other customers sharing our experiences about New York!"
We went on Saturday 11/24/18. We were in NYC for the weekend and wanted Chinese Food but didn’t know which restaurant to pick. I decided to ask some locals and the three of them recommended Joe’s Shanghai and said get the soup dumplings and so we did. They are literally dumplings filled with meat and soup. You hold the dumpling on your spoon and bite the top off. Then you sip the soup out of the dumpling and finally you put the dumpling on your plate and break it apart and eat it. I just loved them. I also had General Tso’s chicken which was very good. There was a long line but we were seated in 15 minutes. Seating is family style so you are seated with other people which I enjoyed. We all spoke with each other. The restaurant is very crowded and the waiters are very efficient.
"Pork soup dumplings were pretty good, crab less so. Water spinach was nice but nothing special and same could be said for tofu in a pork sauce. But it's fun to sit at the communal table and watch the different individuals in each party eat their soup dumplings."
"Come here for the soup-dumplings! They both are amazing. The restaurant is always crowded, but you dont wait long to be seated. Its not very cozy inside, but the staff is friendly and fast and the dumplings amazing. The rest of the menu is ok, but just stick with the dumplings!
They also have a restaurant around 50th street, but its more expensive and has a totally different charme. Come here!"
"I was looking for a simple Chinese restaurant in Midtown and the concierge at the Omni Berkshire Place recommended Joe's.  It was perfect, their brown sauce is perfect."
"- A google search will reveal Joe's as the place to go for soup Dumplings
- The size of their soup dumplings are twice the size of a Dim Sum soup dumpling
- Awards, news paper articles about the restaurant and photos of famous/powerful people eating at Joe's adorn the walls of the restaurant 
- Seating is limited and cramped and wait times can get a bit long, luckily you can place a to go order and skip the line/cramped seating then cross the street and eat your soup dumplings on a bench in a little park."
A definite must !  On a Sunday around 2 there was a 30 min wait outside because the place is small in down town china town. But well worth it! Cash only and there is a atm across the street.  A cozy experience where you may sit at a round table with other people but the more the merrier.
This is in China Town on a little side street. A friend suggested it to us or we would of never went there.  I am so glad we did.  We went on a Friday night and just missed the crowd.  We were seated quickly and the food was amazing.  Would recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants excellent food.
"Famous soup dumpling eatery in Flushing, NY. A must visit if you're ever in NY. Although very busy, service was good and efficient to shorten the wait time."
"Was worth it!! Friend had soup dumplings and raves about it! I had the pickled
Cabbage that was wonderful!! Along with the entrees!!!"
"It was a great experience, the soup dumplings were fresh and perfect!   The scallion cakes were also full of flavor and amazing. Do not miss this spot."
Just get the pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes—-you won’t regret it—-seriously the best!!!  The wait goes fast and is entirely worth it!
It is almost like a small den with lot of people dining .My stomach was upset for days after eating from here
"Great food. Definitely get the soup dumplings! It is cash only so be prepared for that. And they do sit you at a table with other people. The people at our table were cool so it ended up being a fun part of the experience, but if you aren't prepared for that, it could be weird."
Was in NYC and had the Beef Fried Rice. It was good but nothing spectacular. Nice area easy to get to. It is community seating so you will be sharing a table with other people. It is also cash only
Was sat at a group table which was fine but felt the customer service was lacking. We ordered quickly and the food was basically thrown on the table. Restrooms were dirty. Attempted to leave the restaurant and the staff basically just kept walking in the pathway and could careless customers were trying to walk out of the restaurant.
"We received a recommendation to eat at this restaurant from an Asian lady at the Ground Zero memorial-she did not steer us wrong! Of course the dumpling or pork and crab meat, but ooohhhh those scallion pancakes and sauce! Yummy! The wait was about 15 minutes, and it was the only Chinese Restaurant with a wait that we saw at lunch BTW, which tells you a lot! The rating was a “B” but I didn’t SEE anything to put me off and I’m pretty picky. This was one of our most enjoyable meals-certainly nothing fancy, but fun and tasty!Oh, take cash, no cards accepted!"
"The queue is there because the food is very good. It moves efficiently and quickly although the wait for bigger parties is understandably a bit longer. The famous dumplings are delicious. They are a must have. There is a very quick turnaround so not a meal you linger over. From what we saw and ate food was good, fresh and not gloopy! Recommend."
Ate lunch on a Saturday. It was packed! Got pork dumplings and sesame chicken. Both were wonderful but the dumplings were especially wonderful. Make sure to bring cash though as they don’t take debit or credit cards.
"Having to queue and wait for a table was a bit of a clue as to how the meal was going to be.
Four of us ate, all choosing different dishes and all were great.
Certainly a restaurant I would return to and recommend"
"When you come to Chinatown NYC, you must try their famous steamed dumplings with their precious juice inside. 
I do every time I fly to Manhattan.
They are so unique.  Nowhere in Europ. They are named Xiao Long Bao. 
It's a Shanghai special, but I don't know if they are as good as these in NYC. (I've never been in Shanghai)
My stomach can't contain more than these 8 dumplings.  
I'm totally full after having these, but I'm totally happy !"
"Joe’s on Pell St in Chinatown has the best soup dumplings in NY. Pork and crab filling surrounded by broth enclosed in a liquid retaining dumpling is not easy to eat gracefully but is is a wonderful treat. Communal tables and no reservations contributes to this funky place. Although known for soup dumplings other dishes are among the best in Chinatown. Just go to enjoy the food, forget ambiance."
"Not the best Chinese food I’ve ever had however for the Price and how informal it is it’s fantastic value for money. Probably the best quality vs value restaurant I visited in New York. 

The menu is fantastic and there’s loads of choice. I’ll be visiting again no doubt."
I love love love xiao long bao (soup dumplings) so I had to give hem a try at Joes. The buns are large (too large in my opinion) and doughy. Next time I will go back to Xian noodles or Shanghai Cafe Deluxe on Mott Street.
"After reading the other TA reviews and standing in line waiting for 45 minutes last night, we were expecting incredible Chinese.  Instead, the food was good but not great.  Soup dumplings and wonton soup were really tasty and well seasoned.  The Kung Pao chicken, Lo Mein and Pork fried rice were average and not very flavorful at all.  Underwhelming really.  Service was average.   Would not stand in line again for Joe’s."
Good food at good price. It is a noisy place cause is popular and a lot of people come around. A nice stop in Chinatown.
"yes, people are still piling into this chinatown landmark and i'd like to plle on more
kudos...
recently a large group of us, many of whom have lived in hong kong or mainland
china, decided on a ""reunion"" of old asia hands and what better location than joe's...
this place is the very real deal...
i'll skip gushing over the famous dumplings...simply the cuisine real is a good as is
found in the states...
cold sesame noodles...chicken corn soup...jumbo prawns...spicy whole fish...
chicken and veggies...shredded pork...beef and scallions...sauteed string beans...
everything on the menu is superb...
this is a must stop for any lover of chinese food...
do not despair over what can be at times a longish wait...
take an outdoor seat and breathe in chinatown...
all this wait indicates is the popularity of joe's...communal seating is great fun...
don't miss joe's...you'll be spoiled...
important note...cash only"
"After a 20 min wait in line we were ushered to a communal table. Locals proclaimed the soup dumplings were sensational. Other recommendations we tried were the fried green beans, citrus shrimp and scallion pancakes. All were remarkable. Wish we lived closer!"
"Went with a friend and we were lucky to get a shared table really fast. We got pan fried pork dumplings (really good), the chicken with vegetables and the shrimp with scallops which for me it was the best. It was too much food, though. In 2 people, I would probably go for 2 dumplings and one main. Enjoy and have a great meal."
"I like taking family members to places in NYC to try food they normally don't try at home. After a trip to the museum, I took my mom to Joe's Shanghai. I had been one other time prior and it was a perfect late lunch. We had soup dumplings, some pedestrian beef and broccoli, and lo mein. It was all good and an authentic experience. The last time I went it was an hour wait, a late (2pm) lunch had no wait. I LOVE the soup dumplings... that's what you should come here for. CASH ONLY"
"Go for the dumplings and absolutely nothing else, well maybe scallion pancakes. And plan to wait at least 20 min and to be seated with strangers.  And don't forget cash because they don't take cards, but there is an ATM out front."
Great Chinese food in Chinatown. Group seating with great prices. The portions are huge and the soup dumplings are a must try.
"This place is amazing! Great food, fantastic staff and a peaceful atmosphere. I would definitely go again there with my staff."
"We wanted to try soup dumplings at they were amazing! We arrived to Joe’s Shanghai around 12:30 and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. We were surprised that the tables inside a large round tables that seat 10 people, you will be seated with strangers.
The fried rice and lo mein were excellent and very authentic. We will definitely be back!"
We went here after a recommendation from the Concierge in our hotel.  Food was plentiful and nice but after we paid our bill and put in a $19 tip the waiters came back and told us the bill was wrong. We checked we'd paid enough but apparently the TIP wasn't big enough for them. Felt intimidated as there were a few waiters around us.
"We had been recommended Joe’s Shanghai by 2 of the reception team at our hotel and despite having to wait we weren’t disappointed. The dumplings are legendary and they were amazing - the waiter showed us the best way to eat them with chopsticks. The main courses we ordered were equally amazing - 2 chicken dishes and 2 beef dishes. 
We all agreed that it was probably the best Chinese meal we’ve ever had - great place, great atmosphere - definite must!"
"We wanted to try soup dumplings at they were amazing! We arrived to Joe’s Shanghai around 12:30 and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. We were surprised that the tables inside a large round tables that seat 10 people, you will be seated with strangers.
The fried rice and lo mein were excellent and very authentic. We will definitely be back!"
"This is a must go in Chinatown l, it’s delicious and authentic experience. Plan to wait in line and it’s cash only but the food is delicious."
"Ok, but service was unpleasant. It was very weird in NY. Vegetarian food was ok but nothing special."
"Uber driver dropped us here promptly. Thanks.

Dumpling was delicious with meat juice and full flavor. I  enjoyed shrimp dumpling.
Better prepare some cash for paying."
"Me and my family wanted to eat something so we went there. The restaurant was kind of dirty and ugly, I wouldn’t go there again.
The food that we order were very greasy, too much oil. We order three dishes and turned out to be $60, was the food is overpriced"
"This place was recommended to me by a friend and it did not disappoint! We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken and corn soup and fried pork chops. Good value for money and good atmosphere."
"Always a long line at the joe shanghai in China town NYC. My second time visiting the restaurant. The food is good by don’t expect good service as this should be almost normal for people who’s been to many restaurants in CT. But it was my first time sitting in a round table with 2 other parties. If you don’t have a lot of people with you, you will most likely share a table with other people you have never met in your life. But the food is GOOD. So, if your in the mood for some good shangainese dumpling go for it."
"Joe’s Shanghai is always crowded, even for lunch at 3 PM on Wednesday. We were seated quickly at a big round table with another party who are visiting from Europe and spoke no English.The waiters brought the menus with pictures and after much animated discussion they ordered.
 We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, tofu dish, and eggplant. The food was hot, greasy, and completely delicious. Our party of three had a check of less than $40 and leftovers. If you’re visiting New York this place should be on your list."
"I first visited Joe’s when I first came back to NYC over 25 years (gasp) ago, and it still just as good.  Go for the dumplings of course, but there are so many other things including the best Singapore Mai Fun in the city as well as incredible shredded beef and chicken with chewy rice cake.  Go early because there is always a line after 6:30.  One of the top 5 Chinese in the city and that’s saying something."
"We went here as a second choice as our first had a 40 minute wait. My friend & I had both been here before and knew food was good and the wait was only 15 minutes.

The interior has a collection of large round top tables that seat 6-10 people (ish). If you're a smaller party, be prepared to be seated with strangers....and food sharing with them doesn't seem to be a thing.

We ordered a few trays of XLB (Pork) which were good and will def fill any craving but they are def not the best XLB I've had in the states. The tops of the dumplings had a bit too much dough for me. We also ordered some GT chicken. Good but again, not so good that we cleaned the plates.

Service is spotty - we had to ask for water, ask for rice. But if can flag the wait staff, they are quick to fulfill requests.

There's an ATM in the lobby in case you don't have cash. It's a safe place to eat as food is good but is it the best that Chinatown has to offer? Not so sure."
"We just had a party of two. We were sat with a family of four. Everyone pretty much kept to themselves. Based on other reviews we weren’t expecting too much from the servers and knew we were going to be sitting with others. We were fine with both. We had the pork soup dumplings and the fried pork dumplings. Both were good, but the pork soup dumplings were amazing. I would definitely return. Quick delicious visit and worth the uber ride there."
"Um, I went on an article recommendation for the top 50 Foods to eat in NYC before you die and the soup dumplings here were on that list and it didn’t disappoint! 
They only accept cash, and be prepared for a line. Our trip was times perfect I guess cuz we didn’t have a line and we’re sat immediately. Soooo yummy!"
"This is a VERY popular restaurant, with a huge menu.  We went early, after a cruise around Manhattan, and it was a good thing.  By the time we left, the street outside was mobbed with people waiting to get in."
"Handsdown the best restaurant for soup dumplings and other great Chinese dishes as well. It can get a little crowded but for me, it's definitely worth it. The food is great, and the staff is great (if you are patient with them, they will be patient with you). Handsdown a Chinatown staple and would even say one of the best Chinese places in New York City."
"I usually visit Joe's in the winter, since nothing beats a warm soup dumpling when it's cold out, however, they are just as delicious and satisfying even in the dead of summer! Aside from the soup dumplings, I'd recommend the General Tso's chicken...hugh pieces of white meat!"
"I went twice during my stay in New York : the food is excellent , the dumplings delicious , the sweet sour and the casserole really good , the tea is offered , the prices are low . Mind you : you come to eat : you sit with 8 or 10 people at one table : not a romantic outing - but it serves its purpose . I will recommend it and will go back ."
"Everyone I go to NYC, I always make extra time to go to Chinatown and go thi this restaurant. They are well known for their dumplings, which are amazing. Always packed and you will most likely be seating with other people at your table. There is usually a wait, but well worth it."
Servers very attentive and polite. Food was also very good. Must try the soup dumplings and friend pork dumplings!! Would recommend this place.
"Brought our three children here tonight after seeing positive reviews in 2018 DK book. It was a real disappointment. The food was fine, though portions were just ok. However the service was rude, sloppy (starter after main, food slipped down on table) with no engagement with us as customers. Finally it wasn’t great value - there are way better options. It wasn’t hugely busy so there was no excuse. I was sorry we had wasted a trip to Chinatown as it was dirty and a poor experience. Pity as it used to be somewhat charming!"
"A must go when in NY.  We have Din Tai Fung in Seattle, but Joe's is even better.  All of the food was good, but order more dumplings and skip the rest, you won't be sorry.  The dumplings are fantastic!"
"We've been to Joe's Shanghai several times over the years and we've always had to wait for a seat, which we see as a good thing.  Along the way to Joe's we always see similar restaurants with no lines and empty tables but when you turn the corner for Joe's you'll see the people waiting for a table.

On our latest visit we had six people in our party for an early dinner, around 4:30.  The wait was about 30 minutes but may have been shorter had a few of our group not wandered off.  They will not seat the group unless all members of the party are on hand, I think this is standard in NY and probably most busy places.

Our group ordered two orders of the pork soup dumplings, a must if you go to Joe's.  Four in our group had never been before and it was fun watching the newbies try to figure out the process for eating soup dumplings and then seeing their reaction when they taste the broth from inside the dumpling.  These dumplings are absolutely the best I've ever had and never cease to satisfy.  For our main courses we got a couple of General Tao's Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, a seafood dish (I can't remember the name) and a pork dish (I can't remember the name) and a hot and sour soup.  Everyone in the group seemed satisfied with the various dishes and we all left plenty full and happy.  On to the next adventure!"
"First- I didn't have soup dumplings - and might have been the only person not eating them, so this review doesn't take those in account.  For what I did have, it was fine, but really no different than I could have got at my hometown strip-mall Chinese take out restaurant. The place was much too busy for me - people packed in as many tables as they can fit - people bumping you as they walk by. Also if you have empty seats at your table, they will put other people with you.  Also - they only take cash."
"A busy place, but the wait’s because of the great food.  It’s a no-frills restaurant and a bit loud but it’s definitely worth a visit.

I met a friend there for lunch. The two of us were seated at a larger table. Shortly after we were seated another couple were brought to the table.  It reminded me of some European countries where large tables are shared, and we didn’t have any problem with it. 

We started with the scallion pancakes and the pork meat soup dumplings.  The dumplings especially were fantastic. They’re better fresh so we ate them right away.  We also ordered the pan fried crispy noodles with beef for our entrée.  There was plenty of food for the two of us. We had half of the scallion pancakes and more than half of the noodles left over (which made a tasty dinner that evening).

Note that they only accept cash, and the tip is included in the bill. The service is fast and efficient, although it may seem a little brusque if someone is expecting the waiters to act like they do at a standard American chain restaurant."
Very long wait. You have to sit at a table shared by other people. Media hyped but food was not that great. If you're a tourist you might not know better than to eat here
"My daughter recommended this place and the pork and crab meat soup dumplings were just totally amazing with the broth, meat and texture of the dumplings all mixed together into an amazing combination. Pancakes were awesome. Just an amazing meal altogether."
Ordered the fried bean curd in brown sauce.  Not a brown sauce and more or less flavorless.  The water spinach with garlic was good and so were the scallion pancakes.  But not $36 worth of food or service.
These are probably the best soup dumplings I have ever tasted - truly worth risking burning your mouth!
"Very authentic Shanghai restaurant. Noisy, staff are ambivalent but service is reasonable and the food is good. 

We were a little disappointed that there were no vegetarian dumplings on offers as the meat ones looked delicious. 

The veg fried rice was very tasty and the scallion omelette was also good. 

Big helpings, good value for money."
"We queued outside to get into this restaurant. It’s quite funny as they give you a number and make you wait outside until it’s your turn and shout your number. Real Chinese service ;) and reminded me the SPANISH markets many years ago. 
Once you get it the place is basic but food is good, tasty and portions are big. Fried rice is delicious. 
If you happen to be around, a good place to try"
"I loved the restaurant in Chinatown, the staff was friendly and the food was amazing prepared. The dumplings and the tea in the end of the meal were delicious..We have to wait in a line for 15minutes, but worth it. Be prepared with cash, they don't accept any card."
"Usually when you order two dishes at a Chinese restaurant, you expect two reasonable size dishes. However, when two dishes and two rices is suggested to be too much food for two, you know the dish sizes are gonna be good!

Dumplings to start, one main and one rice was plenty for two!

Be aware though, you are likely to be thrown onto a table with a few people. Worked out ok as our new friends were nice people."
"Joe’s is so popular nowadays you might have to wait over an hour for seats on a Friday evening.  But despite its abundance of patronage, this place has remained true to its identity - absurdly delicious dumplings in a no frills setting. You sit elbow to elbow in a room packed to the max with tables, seats, people, and stacks of freshly steamed soup dumplings. The taste of the food here today is just as I remember it when I first ate there.  Why change a good thing right? This is still my go-to for those Shanghainese morsels of joy. Yes, get the soup dumplings. Lots of them!

Go for an early dinner. 6pm is a lot less wait time than 7pm."
"Atmosphere
        When walking to this location it would be easy to turn around if you aren’t familiar with Chinatown. It looks like you are walking into alleys. Don’t let that deter you though. Inside the restaurant is a little run down but nothing I would be concerned about.

Staff
    When we first entered the hostess wanted us to wait the 20 min until our last guest arrived before seating us. We pushed through this a little and told her we wanted a drink now. As we waited for our guest the waiters paced around us like a tiger in a cage, anxious to get things started. We just ignored it.

Food
    For the 3 adults and 2 teens in our group we ordered a #2 dumpling, #71 General Tsos , #78 Dbl pork and #124 Noodles. It was PERFECT!!! All of us left not hungry and couldn’t stop talking about how good the food was. The end bill with 5 beers and 2 pops was $95 (they added the gratuity).
 
I wouldn’t recommend this as a place to sit and chat, as it is loud and not what the restaurant appears to want you to do. But well worth it"
"Whatever else you order, order the soup dumplings: they're what made this place famous (and continue to make it worth the almost inevitable line outside). But don't stop there: we also recommend the fried rice cakes -- cooked to the perfect texture and taste."
"Soup dumplings are good - fun, something different, but not at all delicate. We really enjoyed the beef with fried rice cakes which are like thick, round, sliced noodles. You'll share tables with others. Service is more efficient than friendly. There are better Chinese places but if you really want Chinatown,  go to Joe's."
"Recommended by a friend, so we had to give it a go. We had to wait approximately 15 minutes for a table, which was okay, as we had a seat. The soup dumplings were outstanding, and well worth the walk to get there."
"We came here on a recommendation. We ordered the fried pork dumplings and scallop cake. Both were good in portion and very good in taste.

The water glasses smell like seafood. DO NOT DRINK. Bring your own bottled water there."
"Our taxi driver in the morning had told us to check out the Golden Unicorn later so we walked from the World Trade Center to Chinatown for dinner.  I had checked the hours online to confirm they were open bu t when we got there they informed us they were closed for a private party.  Very ""not cool"" since our party was exhausted and HUNGRY.  Pulled up Google and discovered Joe's Shanghai nearby and so glad we did.  It was only 5:00 so we got right in but we did have to share a table with another family  (don't go if you are interested in a private and/or romantic conversation lol).  I have never had soup dumplings before so I have nothing to compare them to but I thought they were delicious.  I have a picky eater and she actually ate 3 and asked for more.  We also had the sesame chicken (very good) and the beef and broccoli (good).  If we lived in the area, we would definitely visit Joe's again.

BE WARNED that they DO NOT accept credit cards.  Thankfully we had cash on us or we would probably still be there washing dishes to pay for our meal."
"We saw a line outside so thought that it might be good - but were very disappointed. The ""famous"" soup dumplings were just okay.  I lived in Asia for 10 years and ate at Taiwan's Ding Tai Feng many times - which are arguably the best in the world.  These aren't even close - far too large, thick skins, far too much dodgy meat inside - just not pleasant to eat. The other food was barely passable and we left a lot on the table - luckily there was some pizza at home leftover from the kids dinner.."
"Recommended by our hotel, but had to wait 45 minutes to get seated.
Seating is around a large table with other guests, don't go for a cozy meal.
The dumplings were excellent and the two other main dishes we had were both very good. 
The food came very quickly and there was more than enough for both of us.
Prices were reasonable."
Usually a line but the wait isn't too bad.. and it's definitely worth it!  You have to try the dumplings -- they are fantastic!!
We had a short wait to get seated at Joe’s. We were seated at a large round table with 6 other people that we didn’t know. It was pretty loud and tight. We ordered the dumplings which I had read were great but we weren’t big fans of them. The food was just okay. Nothing to rave about.
"We arrived there following recommendations. Crowded, noisy, full of tourists and locals. We shared a table with other turists. Good dumplings but nothing exceptional. Fast service, a place to eat and leave. They ensure that removing the plates and adding new ones while you're still with the tea. Centrally located in Chinatown."
We loved the hustle/bustle atmosphere of the place but this certainly made our waiter rush us slightly with ordering. This was a little off putting but we were firm with wanting more time to look at the menu despite him telling us there’s a 35 minute wait (there wasn’t). They definitely want to turn customers round quickly. That aside the communal dining was enjoyable and had an authentic Chinese restaurant feel to it. The soup dumplings were good and my boyfriends dish (sesame chicken) was delicious. My beef Szechuan was good but the cuts of meat could have been better. We thought it was a good choice in Chinatown.
"Visited over Memorial Day 2018.  Walked up around 6:30 pm on a Saturday and was told a 20 minute wait for a party of 3.  Total wait time was closer to 5 minutes.  Were seated and told to order the pork soup dumplings - absolutely worth it!  Also ordered a few other entrees and drinks.  Service was attentive and fast.  The food was outstanding and in generous portions.  Seating is all family-style at large tables with other groups, so not exactly an intimate experience, but certainly fun.  Soup dumplings were amazing.  BE WARNED...it's cash only."
"Tiny, crowded, busy restaurant with community seating at round tables with lazy susans. The soup dumplings will not disappoint! Cash only establishment.  Left my table to use the restroom and my seat was given to another customer, indicative of the way they attempt to move people in and out very quickly."
"One of my sons wrote a Video Blog about this place, so it was high on my list of places to visit during my annual stop over in the NYC / NJ area. One of the days, 3 of us stopped by  for a late lunch (still it was a 15 minutes wait). The room was full,  it was mainly tourists and the seating's are 6 per table. I wanted to try soup dumplings - my son was talking about.

We ordered an order of crab meat with pork meat soup dumplings (8 is the count) and another order of just pork meat dumplings (8 is the count). Personally, I was not impressed, some how the dough was not cooked properly, my feelings is that the kitchen was  rushing the orders out.

My son also admitted that his first stop here was much different (talking about quality of the dumplings). Is it just a bad day for a cook, maybe?  In any case, the bills are paid in cash only, gratuity is already included and I don't plan to come back here any time soon. One thing is - this place located in the China town on the block with the most ready for Instagram pictures."
"We were initially skeptics but we shouldn’t have been. 
Yes it’s cash only
Yes you sit with others

The food is great, lots of it, quick service. 

You must try the soup dumplings there really really good. 

The que is quick and it’s just a great experience"
"Good not great Chinese. The general Tso’s chicken was very good. The spring rolls were not very good. They were very small with hardly any filling, which is very unfortunate. Service was good. Very friendly staff."
The dumplings were very good as well as the fried rice.  We were walking by and just needed s little something to eat between meals.   Very small restaurant but very good service and food.  I would go back and do recommend it
"Great food, great service, fun place to eat.  Would highly recommend. Reasonable prices. Most seating is at large round tables where you can meet others."
"One of my favorite Chinese places however it always has a grade pending for it's health grade as required by NYC. We went there recently to find it has a ""c"" rating hidden on an inside door. A b rating means problems, a c is downright gross."
"Worth the 45 min wait! Cash only but the soup dumplings were fabulous but my favorite was joes Shanghai noodles, unbelievable and green beans. Great prices, fast service once your in and huge soup dumplings."
A NYC police office recommended Joe's Shanghai on Pell.  The food was 5 star but the restaurant was very business and we were told that Credit Cards were not acceptable...BRING CASH!!
There some amazing places to get great Asian food in Chinatown. The experience is just different from the main stream foodie tour. Joes is a long term staple. Most are seated together w strangers on 10 top circular tables. Sometimes it hard to know who ordered what or even what your getting unless you speak mandarin. But that’s part of the fun. The wait staff means business and is always in a hurry.  It can be very popular so gets crowded but the turn over is fast. The soup dumplings are the most famous. Certainly worth a trip.
"We arrived right at opening and had no wait.  Service was prompt and they asked if we wanted soup dumplings pretty much as soon as we sat down.  We ordered the crab and pork dumplings, one order of pork soup dumplings, crispy prawns in meat sauce, and a scallion pancake.  The soup dumplings are excellent.  You have to be very gentle removing them from the steamer so you don’t rip a hole and lose the soup.  Put the dumpling in your soup spoon, bite off the top knot, slurp up the soup and then finish the dumpling!  Great food!  Cash only though so be prepared!"
"I took my husband and had to be sure he tasted and enjoyed soup dumplings....mmmm he loved them!!  Go now!! Midtown or Chinatown.

Try to go during off-hours or be prepared to wait in line."
"Our family of 6 really enjoyed the soup dumplings, green beans, scallion beef and seafood noodle dish. We even ordered extra soup dumplings at the end of the meal! Great experience having the soup dumplings - a lovely staff member offered help on eating it the best way and it was great to have the tip. Cash only, so be sure to come prepared!"
"When we walked in way after lunch thought it would be quiet, to our surprise it was busy if fact we had to share a table with other people.
The food was really good, you have to have the soup dumplings the specialty."
"CASH ONLY. CASH ONLY. 
That was the #1 reason I did NOT want to come here, because we were running out of cash. However, the place we wanted to go to had a private function so we ended up here, the biggest tourist trap in Chinatown but we were tourists so there ya go. 

NO RESERVATIONS. 
Yet another reason I didn't not want to come here. I don't like waiting for tables, especially on vacation in 30 degree weather outside (because yes you have to wait outside for a table). I rather go to McDonalds than have to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated.

THEY PACK IT IN.
There are no empty seats available in the entire restaurant. They will pack you in like sardines, and everyone has coats and stuff when we visited in March, so there is NO ROOM to walk and you are butt to butt with everyone around you.

SERVICE.
This is universal Chinese service wherever you go I suppose. You really gotta speak up if you want something because they can't read your mind. Ever. 

FOOD.
Excellent. My son who never eats Chinese food said it is now his favorite cuisine (!!) after eating here. He enjoyed the crispy pan fried noodles and the fried fish with dry seaweed dish. Pretty much ruined it for all the Chinese places back at home.  I don't usually like Chinese food and it's never my first or second (or third) choice but I really enjoyed ALL of our dishes here. I went back to a place in Hawaii that I thought had this type of Chinese food and it was terrible. 

It's CASH ONLY and for our party of 5, that was a lot of cash that I didn't anticipate needing for on our trip. Other than that, if you're a tourist like us, worth a stop into Chinatown. If not, I would never have seen Canal Street and Little Italy on our trip. That in itself was an experience we won't forget lol."
First time having soup dumplings and had a good experience here. The wait is long on weekends but kinda worth it for the soup dumplings... not sure about the other food.
"OK people, it is not a fine dining establishment. It's Chinatown! I you want the best soup dumplings ever, just go! A must-stop every time we are in the city. Arrive early if you are not one to tolerate waiting. Got there on a weekday at 11:30 with no wait at all. The place was filled up by the time we left."
The Lions Head and the green beans.  The soup dumplings are a must but we were surprised at how good the green beans with minced pork were. Perfectly sautéed and very flavorful. The lions head are meat balls made from pork belly served with box choy.  Really good. 30 minute wait at 6:30 on a Saturday night.
"No reservations you have to put your name in and then stand there because they will come out and call your number and if you don’t answer ,they will erase it, so if you get through that process enough to actually have your name called for an actual table be prepared to share it. So if you make it that far to the table that you are now sharing and you order the soup dumplings maybe you will like them more than I did ,they resemble a man’s body part and you don’t dare eat them with the soup in it or you will scorch your tongue. There’s so much good Chinese in the city that doesn’t require waiting I recommend going somewhere else."
Came directly to Joe's upon entering china town.  I had heard about their amazing soup dumplings.  We ordered two orders of pork soup dumplings.  They were pretty dense and not nearly as good as I expected unfortunately.  The service was very good as was the hot tea.  Perhaps we should have diversified our order but we moved on.
"Our trip to Joe's Shanghai was probably the best Chinese meal I've ever had.

The dumplings are incredible and the General Tso's chicken was cooked to perfection. 

They don't accept reservations so be prepared to wait outside (although as a party of 2, we were seated immediately).

The seating is strange as you share a round table with strangers but that adds to the character of the place. I will definitely go back here."
Stopped in after trekking 3 miles from hotel to Chinatown. A friend suggested this place and we figured we would give it a try. We were blown away. Best dumplings and pork fried rice I have ever had!! Huge portions. We should have split one dish but it was worth the belly ache from overeating!!
"Great food, large portions.  Plan on eating a lot, sharing, or leaving some of it behind.  Restaurant is packed with people and found in the heart of China Town.  Good complimentary hot tea placed on every table.  It’s an experience."
"4 of us visited here after seeing the reviews on tripadvisor.
We all thought we had got the wrong place.
It is located down a dirty litter filled street and looks derelict from outside. 
The staff were rude and slightly aggressive and just seemed to want to hurry us all the time. 
The place was filthy, with dust and grime stuck to all of the faux Chinese decorations. 
Members of staff were asleep next to the toilet, which hadn't had a decent clean in years. 
The food was below average too. 
Also it's the only Asian restaurant that I have ever been served cold sake. 
Chinatown as a whole was dirty and disappointing but there has to be much better restaurants than this one."
"I went this restaurant with my colleagues for dinner. We had spring rolls, wanton soup, scallion pancakes, soup dumplings, and deep friend chicken. In general, except the friend chicken, most of them were good. The fried chicken was too hard to chew. We had only one piece each, and left them. Nobody wanted to take it home. Especially, we enjoyed scallion pancakes and wanton soup. We definitely go back for them. One thing I don't like is they accept only cash."
"From the outside, this looks like a place where you'd think twice whether to venture in... but on the inside it's a great Chinatown restaurant with amazing food and quick service. Try the dumplings filled with meat and broth (don't burn your mouth)... green tea is free, btw."
"We had the dumplings (crab/pork and chicken), as well as the General Tso’s chicken. All very good. Great service."
We pulled up in a taxi into what was just like a scene from Big Trouble in Little China and walked into this real no frills restaurant.  We were seated on a large table with other people which we found really great having a chat with some local New Yorkers.  The food was quite simply great authentic tasty Chinese cuisine and we had a great night.  Its also great value for money which was quite refreshing in New York.  A tip is Its cash only but there is an ATM located in the doorway.  We would highly recommend!
"Joe's Shanghai is obviously super famous for its soup dumplings - and for good reason. These squishy little satchels filled with brothy goodness are absolutely worth waiting in line for a table. Service is prompt and unfussy, turnover high, and the long line of parties waiting to get a table moves quite quickly, despite the popularity. Fun and raucous environment, perfect for a group of 4-6 for an entertaining and delicious meal."
"We came back here as we loved it on our last visit to NYC. The scallion pancake was so very good, the eggplant and pork in chilli sauce superb and their soup dumplings were as good as ever. Great restaurant at great price!!"
"Was strongly recommended to visit on various sites etc so thought its a must visit. However, being a vegetarian i was disappointed. Though they have a lot of options for main course, not a single choice in appetisers. The famous ""soup dumpling"" doesnt have a vegetarian option. Also, its shared seating - which I didn't really enjoy. Service was quick."
"We go for the soup dumpling as they are delicious but all the other food is also worth a try. The place gets crowded and you might end up sharing a table but it is still worth the effort. Be prepared as they only take cash, no credit cards accepted. They don't take reservations, so try to go on off hours"
"A girlfriend and I enjoyed Joe's on a cold Friday evening in New York.  We had crispy Scallion pancakes and hot pork soup noodles- both delicious.  A bit difficult to eat the soup noodles, but fun.  Nice crowd of people which is lucky because you sit close to other patrons.  Also had shrimp fried rice which was nothing special."
We ate here for dinner one evening. We ordered several items to try. We ended up throwing everything away. It was not good! Do not recommend!
"Prepare to wait outside for a table. The whole process was a bit confusing with the numbers and illogical method.
The place is really noisy and busy. You been ushered to table and ask the order. Once you eate the aperticers, your plate were pulled away before your mouth were empty. Dumplings were good but nothing special. Main course was tasty. Food was cheap. Overall the experience was what you can expect from a busy Chinese restaurant. Hype is overrated. Good Chinese above average."
We went durning lunch hour and weirdly had to share a table with two other groups. Thankfully we got to visit with a nice couple. The steamed dumplings were good. Everything else was your typical Chinese restaurant buffet in the Midwest.
"Since the main focus of this place and the rave about it is about the xiao long bao, that's all I will comment on. In my opinion, I think it is definitely not the best xiao long bao. Simply, Din Tai Fung is leaps and bounds better. Its o-kay, just not better than decent."
"Don't expect a fancy place, just go and enjoy their famous ravioli and their pork noodles. They have good vegetarian options as well"
"For our Chinatown visit we decided to stop at Joe's Shanghai after a recommendation from our hotel. 
Very typical place we were seated at a large table with other people. Ordered some dumplings, rice and two types of noodles one with smoked fish and one prawns and peas.
All plates were great loved the taste and food. 
Good service
Paid 60$
Only lower note servers don't speak English well"
This is our favorite place for soup dumplings - xiao long bao - in Chinatown.  We always order the rice cakes too!  Be prepared to wait for a table.
"The food is pretty good although the waiter warned my vegetarian daughter off of one meal, telling her ""NOT GOOD!""  Wish I could remember what it was so that I could warn TripAdvisor Travelers.   

It's crowded, come early - they give you numbers and have you wait out in the street.   Very busy spot.   We waited over 30 minutes for a spot for 5 people which we shared with another group of 5.

I had the pork soup dumplings, very good & General Tsao's Chicken.   No complaints."
"We were told about this restaurant by a waiter at our hotel and a bus tour guide. Of course when in New York you must eat Chinese in Chinatown, and this place was recommended so we went. The whole experience was worth the wait, between queuing outside waiting fr our number to be called, sit with other people at the table, and eating our weight worth of dumplings! Yes, they are the best I've had!"
"The food here was very good! We went for lunch so the wait time was not bad! The only thing Is that you can be seated with other customers if that's the only table available & you don't want to wait. This was a little weird for me. The soup dumplings are great! Our kids loved the onion pancakes! The other food was good but not great. The price was great for NYC, but its cash only. We would definitely go back if we are in NYC again."
"Honestly the soup dumplings (crabmeat and Pork) are amazing- as you can see from other reviews.A good portion of 8 arrive in a large basket- rather tricky to eat as they explode once pierced, the soup poring out.Never worked out an elegant approach just resigned myself to chomping through and getting messy.In addition to these we had General Tso's chicken- big succulent chunks, salted and soicy shrimp (off the shell) fabulous.
We were sat at out own small table for 2, restaurant was really busy, some of the larger tables are community ones with 6 people sharing but this is not an issue for me.
The table next to us had a flounder with Ginger and Spring Onion- will definitely be looking at having this next time.

Service was delivered quickly without fuss-typical chinatown I would say-don't expect too much here.

Price came in at a reasonable $80

Best meal we had all week."
"We stopped in here as we walked around the city.  We were seated right away at a community table.  We ggot the fried dumplings.....amazing, the pork fried rice(by far the best I have ever tasted and an order of the soup dumplings.  Loved it all.   FYI....CASH ONLY"
"The Soup Dumplings were amazing, totally loved them!

It was definitely worth the trip downtown. Although it was very crowded, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. I guess the table-sharing is the reason behind that. We even shared some food with our new table buddies. Not the soup dumplings though, obviously. . . to good to share with anyone actually ;-)

We had ordered some Chinese greens as a side-dish and they did as well, so that was good to share. Greens and dumplings are a good combo and all in all we were pretty full, ordering two sets of dumplings for two was more than enough, leaving you satisfied and not craving desert afterwards."
"Joe’s Shanghai is a good place to eat ,their soup dumplings are good ,pricey but it’s worth.The downside of this restaurant are overcrowded,there is no privacy because you have to sit with strangers on the same table and the bad part that I really don’t like is that their staff are rude ,they need to learn some good customer service and etiquettes in accommodating their customers.Perhaps it’s a language barrier but there is a room for modifications on how to deal with different customers with different backgrounds and nationalities."
We waited for Dim Sum and ordered the Spring rolls and the Pork steamed buns.  The pork buns (8) were served in a steaming basket and you put one on a soup spoon and gently ate into it.  It is filled with the most delicious broth and meat...so savory.  The place was packed and very efficient to turn tables over.
I had been in this restaurant a few times before so I wanted to take my wife for good Chinese on her first trip to NYC.  This place never fails but this time was not as good as other times.  The service was ok as it took too long to get served and way too long to get a beer.  Ordered soup dumplings and fried rice which were good but not as other times. Next time I'm in NYC I will try other places.
"We went on a soup dumpling crawl through Chinatown, this was our last stop, but had the best of the seven we tried. Restaurant was packed, and we shared a table with another couple, but service was prompt. Crab and pork dumplings had just the right balance of seafood and meat. Also ordered sesame chicken, which was also very good. Worth the wait to get in."
"We just got back from a trip with our 6 and 8 year old daughters. We went to Joe’s during our visit to Chinatown and it was one of our favorite meals of the trip! We all loved the pork dumplings, as well as the other dishes we ordered. The portions were large and the hot tea was nice after a long wait in the cold. I highly recommend this place!"
"Just wanted to try Chinese food in NY since I normally live in Hong Kong.
Everything we ordered was far more greasy and almost tasteless compared to back home.
Xiao long bao are average..the pastry too thick.
No idea why this place is so popular.
Also..not a fan of black money Chinese vendors keep doing with 'no credit card' policy.
Shouldn't everybody pay taxes in the US?"
Run don’t walk to this fabulous restaurant where you can get the most amazing soup dumplings. We had an order of spring rolls and we each had an order of dumplings. Chicken and pork. They were so delicious!
25 Dec 2017. Christmas Lunch. Had to wait over an hour outside in freezing temperatures but is was well worth it. Not usually a fan of Chinese food because of the amount of MSG that is used but I have to say that there was no MSG in sight. The dumplings (pork soup) were fantastic as were the other dishes ordered. Portions were generous and it was very good value for money. Definitely going back when next in NYC.
"We visited Chinatown whilst in NYC to try and grab the feel of Shanghai which we had missed so much since repatriating to the UK, over 12 months ago...

We were not disappointed, we chose the best place to eat and we felt like we were back in the heart of China.

My recommendation is to get there early, we were at the door for 11:00am, but within 20 minutes the place was fully seated.

Service was quick and friendly, food was absolutely fantastic.....

Highly recommend a visit!"
"We went and waited an hour. It’s family style seating, so you get to sit with strangers;) which makes it way more fun!!!

Order the soup dumplings. Don’t do anything else until you do. Don’t think about it. Don’t plan ur whole meal. Just order them when you sit down. Everything about them is divine (yes i used the word divine;). The noodle/dough is perfectly made. Not too thin, not to thick. The soup is hot and well seasoned. The crab/pork filling is yumminess. Did i mention to order the soup dumplings???

Everything else was on the same level - scallion pancakes, citrus shrimp, double cooked pork and oh, the soup dumplings;)"
"After waiting for almost 1 hour in the freezing New York winter we
were seated by the entrance door where we froze some more. 
I had the noodles sauteed with meat,the soup dumplings and my friends
chose several other entrees,some very hot and some lukewarm..
I didn't tasted anything worth the long wait,hurried service and noisy
crowded stereotypical interior but people do seem to love what they get.
Is this place just a gimmick perhaps? Gullible tourists and
long lines make curious people to pay for an average meal more
than is worth?
You tell me!! but after 4 visits is was enough for me."
Delicious food. Busy restaurant but good atmosphere. Food portions are huge ao sharing is ideal but it didn't say this on the menu so we ended up over ordering which equally led to a hefty bill for lunch. But we have no regrets! Defo worth a visit.
The wait was long in the middle of a weekday afternoon but the perfectly made soup noodles were our reward.  The moo shu pork and scallion pancakes were also flavorful and reminiscent of native Shanghai cuisine.
"Very authentic and loved the location on a narrow street in Chinatown. I have traveled in China and it felt just like being there. Food was wonderful and it was crowded, but we were seated quickly. We shared a large table with other groups, just like in China. Photos of celebrities line the walls who have eaten there. Extensive menu and hot tea served with your meal."
"Shrimp fried rice, spring rolls
Sat down, waiter said ""dumplings""
we said no. He said we had to order in two minutes or they were closing (it was 1020pm, they close at 11pm). I said we would like to see a menu, he said if we didn't order in 2 minutes that they were closed.
I asked for a menu. He begrudgingly got us one [to share].
We thankfully got a new waiter who was friendly. We ordered fried rice and spring rolls. He asked if we wanted anything else, we said since they were closing we just wanted that but thanked him.

Food: greasy, no flavor, we were not given water nor asked what we wanted to drink.

Food was served quickly. The oranges for desert were nice."
This place is great for grabbing a quick lunch. We had two orders of soup dumplings. This place isn’t fancy but it is good.
"We went here in search of the ""best"" dumplings in NYC Chinatown. Not only were the soup dumplings delicious but we also ordered scallion pancakes and lo mein which were equally good.  Service was fast and efficient and while the restaurant was busy because we visited at an off hour (mid-afternoon on a  weekday there was no wait,  Definitely worth a visit."
"In the middle of china town you find a interesting restaurant, looks authentic. Ask different plates and share. A little cleaner would be great."
"Went here whilst in new York. We saw the queue outside so got a number and got in line, we got told a out 15 mins. After about half an hour we got told they were cleaning a table for us after we had asked how long it would be (there was 7 of us so we understood it would take a short while) We then watched as a group of 3 and a group of 4 got put on the table were waiting for AND we had been waiting longer them then. After quite a while after that we left as we were ignored when asked what was going on. The whole place looks old and not well laid out and you get put on tables with other people just to fit you in. Not impressed."
"My favorite Chinese in NY, way better than the one they have near the MOMA, different and delicious!"
My boyfriend demands we go here every time we're in the city. Soup dumplings are great. The fried rice is all so yummy too.
"We ended up here after a cold day of exploring NYC.  We waited about 20 minutes and were sat at a group table, really cool to sit and eat with strangers and talk and share stories etc.  We had the soup dumplings, they were AMAZING!!!"
"Visited here for my birthday after looking on TripAdvisor (our original choice of restaurant was closed, so came here in stead) ranked about 400 out of 14,000 restaurants at the time. 
The restaurant was packed out - good sign. We had to wait 45 minutes for a table - good sign. Hell NO!
When we got a table we were seated with 3 other couples around a pretty squished table. Within seconds the waiter came up gave up menus and tried to hurry us into ordering dumplings! We said “err, can we have a look first” 
We ordered 2 + 1 beers, fried dumplings, steamed buns, Kung Po chicken and fried rice. If you’re looking for value, this place definitely meets the mark. The fried dumplings were good, our steamed buns came as dumplings but were very good, fried rice and Kung po were ok, it filled us up.
We visited on a very busy Saturday night, it wasn’t colourful and vibrant, that we can live with, the place was just chaos. 
Service didn’t exist, they obviously just wanted you in and out as soon possible. When we got our bill it and a plate of oranges was Frisbee across the table at us.
Our bill was $62.55 which for volume of food was good, but quality was less than average. I fail to see what people get out of this place. I asked to keep the bill (we always do) was told he needed it for the till,  the bill never reappeared. I asked again and was told he could write one, how much would I like it for? 😂
Would we return? Never!"
Had an order of all 3 soup dumplings and they were amazing. Really good dumplings at Joe's. I'll be headed back to them for dumplings for sure.
"Great soup dumplings and great food. Not fancy but very tasty! We had the pork fried rice, bok choy and beef and broccoli. This is definitely authentic in the heart of Chinatown. It’s a must for some great food."
"It was crowded but that’s a must !! Food was very very good !!! 
Service was quick , and as soon as we finished our last bite they took away the dishes and brought the bill, without us ordering it ... a thing that is impossible in Europe !! 
I wanted another drink but .... not possible !! 
That’s maybe the American way ... 
anyhow ... it’s worth to go to eat"
Had awesome and authentic dumplings and other Chinese dishes. Was so good that I went there several times while staying close by. Can get crowded so be prepared to wait depending on when you get their but the food is amazing so well worth it.
"The soup dumplings are the same as at Joe's Shanghai - that is to say, pretty decent.  But I went with a friend and we ordered the supposedly spicy eggplant with chicken and prawns and it was, simply, one of the worst Chinese dishes I've ever had.  Gloopy sweet brown sauce, undercooked chicken, tiny shrimp, barely a hint of spice and... $20.25 for a small portion!  Rice is $1 extra.  I would skip this place."
"A friend who lives in Manhattan recommended this place to us when we were there visiting.  We got there around 9pm on a Friday, and the place was packed!  We waited for about 30 minutes, which seemed totally reasonable based on how many people were waiting already. 

Get the soup dumplings!  They are one of the best deals in the city, and so delicious.  We also got sesame beef, some fried noodles, and General Tso's chicken.  Everything was so tasty, and we had plenty of food for 4 of us.  Everything we saw come out of the kitchen looked tasty, and we would definitely go back the next time we are in NYC."
"if you like chinese kichen, you should come here to try the dumplings, are AMAZING!! you have to wait for a while but worth, the pork and shrimps dumplins are the best.
and is in chinatown so perfect for a chinese restaurant in new york"
"We heard about the great soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai, we were not disappointed. Good service dumplings we're very good, reasonable prices."
"Far in Chinatown we found the resturant that was recommended on Tripadvisor. Appearingly, I do not think I had entered there, but we trusted in previous reviews. The noise level in the room was high, but it is often in NY. We were assigned two chairs around an 8-man table where there were 6 strangers. Unusual for a Norwegian but very natural in such a place. After a while, we ordered what we hoped were spring rolls and roasted ""fat noodles"" with chicken. The food came quickly and was very good and in large quantities. Then the staff were courteous and helpful. Well worth a visit!"
"Every time I goes to New York City, I goes to Joe's Shanghai. Now they have a mid-town location, making it more convenient if I stay in mid-town area. In 2005, when I first went there, I thought the soup dumpling is phenomenal, the first time I had the same quality since I left Shanghai.  Yes, you had to wait in line and eat with other folks. But I think it is worth it.
Over the years, with soup dumplings getting more popular, and popping up even in mid-size cities without a China town, like the one I live, I do not taste that ""wow"" factor when I go to Joe's Shanghai, but I still enjoyed each visit. Compared with other places, the dumplings in this place seems to be more juicy, with more flavor soap. 
Maybe not the only place to go, but still worth the visit."
"To get sit round a table with other visitors is a nice experience. 
The food is nice, take many smaller and taste them all!"
"Having travelled to the USA from the UK we wanted a Chinese style dining experience and having bumped into a Chinatown Cop I asked for a recommended place to try and was directed to this restaurant.
Having met the door greeter we were given a ticket to wait our turn (1/2 hour wait) in the street before being taken to a community table shared with another family.
On Their recommendation we ordered the specialty of the house Soup Dumplings - OMG They are amazing ! Followed by General Tsao Chicken & Chicken fried noodle with a single bowl of plain rice - way more than two can eat! 
This place is great for Food, Great for the Chinese dining Experience and on top of all that Great for the price. Having read previous reviews I guess everyone has different views and experiences but ours was completely positive."
"Waited in line 30-45 minutes based on reviews.  Ordered duck, dumplings and chicken cabbage dish.  All edible but nothing I can say Wow about or it was woth the wait.  Not going back."
"The food at Joe's Shanghai was excellent. For 7 diners, we chose 3 orders of dumplings, but 2 would have been plenty with all the entrees we ordered: Crispy Shrimp, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and a beef/mushroom dish. Ask the server for a recommended number of entrees for your group. Then, if you've ordered dumplings as starters, reduce his suggestion by one entree. You can order sides of rice, but rice does not appear to come with most entrees, and you probably win't need it anyway. We could not eat all we ordered and had to leave it because  of limited refrigerator space in our hotels. Complimentary pots of a very delicate tea flowed constantly, but you can order other beverages. 
At peak dining times, be prepared to wait. We only had a 15-20 minute wait at 7:30 on a Wednesday, but I imagine weekend waits would be longer - diners are given numbers and wait outside on the sidewalk until they're called. The restaurant is very crowded, and more than one group may be seated together, especially at the larger tables. Our group was seated at a big table where a couple was just finishing up. As soon as their dishes were cleared, two others were seated. They didn't stay long and were quickly replaced by two more with whom we had a great time visiting. Waiters rush around constantly. 
Note:  Only cash is accepted - no credit cards."
"A group of 11 of us were accommodated upstairs at Joe’s.  Wow....all of us were pleased by the presentation, the tasty, large portioned lunch we each had....from chicken/peanuts to sesame chicken and everything in between. This was so much better than what we ate in Chinatown.  Will definitely return."
I ate here while I was walking through Chinatown. It had good reviews and it was rated “A” in the window by the city inspectors for cleanliness. It was really crowded and warm inside which made for kind of an uncomfortable dining experience. I had pork dumplings and Shanghai noodle soup. I would give both an average grade and I found the soup stock kind of bland. The price was decent but I would recommend the place for a meal if you’re looking for flavourful dinner.
"Friend recommended this one from her last trip in New York. Saw a lot of customers lining up when we arrived, but no Asian. All English speaking customers maybe the Chinese knew this one is not authentic Shanghai cuisine. After went in, we shared a round table with another two group of clients, squeeze and uncomfortable. Tried the famous dumpling however it only good at size, but not the taste."
"We stopped at Joe’s Shanghai in Chinatown for a quick dinner before heading home after an exhausting day in downtown NYC! As usual the place is packed but we were able to grab a table on the second floor.  The service is diligent and quick and the food is always fresh and delicious!  After having spent the entire day enjoying different small plates in various places in Little Italy where we joined the celebration of the Saint Genaro Feast, we kept our dinner selection light.  My husband and I shared the combination Pork and Crab Soup Steamed Dumplings and Crispy Shrimp dish as the Entrée served with white rice.  Steamed soup dumpling is the signature dish at this restaurant and I concur!  They are light pillows of dough with a tasty meaty filling enveloped in a liquid sauce which characterizes the dish..  Delightful!  I can make a meal just of these!!!  I do prefer the pork dumplings to the crab ones, though… but they are both great!!!  The shrimp dish turned out to be in a spicy semi-sweet garlicky sauce which went absolutely well with the white rice.  This restaurant never disappoints!  When you are in the area and in the mood for great steamed soup dumplings do not hesitate to give Joe’s Shanghai a try!"
"Went here after a recommendation, and it lived up to expectations.  We had both steamed and fried dumplings which were as good as anything we've had in China.  Service was efficient, although not overly friendly.  Very reasonable priced, with complimentary tea.  Visit at a quiet time if you don't like queuing."
"You are no longer greeted at the door. You are simply directed to a spot to sit. If you are alone, as I was, you will likely be placed at a large round table already occupied by other folks. Not a problem, and sometimes a benefit, when you meet new folks excited about tasting the cuisine.  But now, the server takes his time to get to you and take your order, and averts his gaze when you are trying to catch it. Most disappointing, however, was that the once-fabulous soup dumplings were only mediocre, and maybe a point or two less than that. When my basket of dumplings came to the table, it was clear that it had been waiting too long to be delivered to me. The dumplings were lukewarm, and the bottoms of each dumpling had sunken into the wood slats supporting them, creating a very sad condition--when you plucked the dumpling up to place it on your plate, a piece of the bottom would tear off, spilling much of  the fragrant, tasty soup out before it could be enjoyed. The eating experience was off putting. The dumplings were chewy, having been left out so long, and likely overcooked, and the bites of meat without the broth it was meant to go with lacked the usual explosion of flavor."
We got the soup dumplings and they were great - - - I even scrapped all the cabbage off the bottom of the platter!  Our family of five ordered a variety of plates and all were excellent.  The ambiance is appropriate for this type of restaurant.
"We went to its midtown location, as it is closer to our hotel and people say the line is much shorter.  At 11:45, we were seated without wait.  The famous soup dumpling was delicious, however compared to other famous soup dumpling restaurant like Ding Tai Fong, the excitement is just not there. Guess we are spoiled in the west coast.  And although the toppings are excellent, the noodle is not chewy and is tasteless."
"Went here based on tour book review and on-line reviews. Be prepared for long waits (1 hr plus) and to share a table with others. Once inside, service is brisk though not personable. We ordered the xiao long bao a.k.a soup dumplings and they were huge and soupy. We have had soup dumplings all around the world and these were not the best, but decent. The other shanghai food items e.g. pancake/flat fried noodles were reasonably tasty and a good sized portion. While good, I'm not sure if I would wait 1 hr again."
"When you eat in Chinatown, you don't necessarily go for atmosphere or service but for the food! If you want consistent, fresh, yummy food - you go here. I'm sure there are other places in Chinatown that are great but once you find one you know is consistent, why change? Yummy noodles, dumplings...etc. - you kind of have to know ahead of time what you plan on ordering. You have to understand that most waiters in chinatown do not like waiting around forever for you to make up your mind. Be prepared to eat on ""shared tables"" with strangers - but hey, its NYC chinatown and look at everything as an ""experience"" and you'll be fine. You can always look at what other people are eating and say ""I want that"""
Talk about OLD School...WOW!! Dumplings are AMAZING!! Great place and when you see that most of the Customers are Asian...you know it has to be good. Get there at 12:30pm for lunch and be prepared to wait but it is worth it.
"Decided to try this place based on good reviews from TA and other sites.

When we pulled up to the restaurant it was almost a mob scene of people waiting on both sides of the street for their turn to be seated.  We had to wait for our number to be called and they said it would take about 25 minutes.  Considering the number of people waiting, I didn't believe them.  But they were right. :-)

Two important things to know about this place:  1.  Cash Only and 2. They have community tables.

So we were seated with three other parties (we were a party of 3).  Two couples and another party of 3.  The seating was quite tight.

We ended up getting Beef and Broccoli, Szechuan Beef, Kung Pao Chicken, Pork Dumplings and Pork/Crab Dumplings.

Everything came out fairly quick.  Was it the best chinese ever?  Absolutely not.  But it was good...especially the Pork/Crab Dumplings and the Kung Pao Chicken.  Besides that, not really sure what the wait and the hoopla was all about.

Definitely not a fan of table sharing.  But if you like freshly made dumplings this is a good options but not much variety.  I'm not comfortable giving this place a ""very good"" rating.  And I'm not comfortable giving them an ""average"" rating.  The experience and food was simply ""good""."
"A friend from Manhattan brought us for the chicken soup dumplings. There was a line up outside it was so busy! The place is a bustling packed little restaurant with not much room for chairs even. The dumplings were as promised - super yummy, and super hot! I'm glad we got lots of them for everyone to enjoy, because we all had 6+ each! I didn't see the rest of the menu."
"We went there after reading multiple positive reviews on TA and were disappointed. The service is terrible, from the attitude of the waitress that seated us to the complete lack of care of the waiter. The dumplings were ok but the shrimps were far too sugary. The chicken was coated in a very thick sugary sauce too. All in all a disappointing experience."
"After looking around Chinatown somewhere to eat, we ended up at Joe's Shanghai-- then received a locals recommendation and decided that the 20 minute wait must be worth it -- glad we waited! Dumplings were great! Two of us left stuffed and the bill was under $20. 👍🏼"
Great food here as long as you can find it.  We walked past it twice until we found it.  The soup dumplings were great.  Staff was nice and fast.  Seating was quick because they will sit you where ever there is a spot.  Even if it's next to someone you don't know at a table.  This kind of gives it a friendly atmosphere.
"Their food is absolutely amazing and the best I've ever tried. It's so good that we visit them every time we go to new york. I highly recommend their steamed dumplings with pork, because they always taste so good, especially with the sauce. I also love their general tso's chicken, as it is not too crispy like in most other restaurants, but has the perfect amount of crispness and very tender chicken, and lots of sauce. But, there are some things that you should be warned about. Their restaurant is very popular, so if you are coming in with more than two people, you may have trouble getting in. Also, their service is pretty poor, which is typical for new york. The waiters can be a bit rude and walk off before you finish your order, but it's manageable. Also, you are seated at large tables with people you don't know, but my family and I don't mind because you just talk to the people that you do know and do your own thing. And finally, if you can't use chopsticks, you WILL have to ask them for a fork, or bring your own. But I still give them five stars, because their food is absolutely amazing, and the things that they do that aren't perfect are very typical for NYC restaurants, so you might not find much better. But even so, I highly recommend them."
We came to this location in an effort to have authentic Chinese while on our vacation to New York. We chose this due to other reviews. When we arrived we were given a raffle type ticket with a number on the back and had to wait in the street which smelled like trash. When our number was called we went in to find that we had a half of a table. As in tables were divided by table 1a and 1b. We sat with two different people as the first couple was almost done when we arrived. The server came over and stood there waiting for our entire order as we ordered appetizers and a entree as well. My water cup was dirty on the outside and this place was COVERED with dirt/dust. Frankly I can't believe we even stayed. My son had to go find the server to ask for a fork. The top is already included so I'm sure they could care less. The entree tasted just like the food at the mall. There is no way I could recommend this restaurant.
"Do i have to say more??? soup dumplings, the best of the best. Every time I go to NYC, I go to this restaurant, and I don´t care what else is on the menu, I always order the soup dumplings, and they never dissapoint. 
A few things: there is a wait time to go in, most of the tables are shared, and this is one of the places where chinese people go
definitely go there!!"
"We went here based on a recommendation from friends of ours who moved back to Atlanta after living in NYC for a few years.  We walked in and were immediately seated.  Just know going into this place, there is a possibility of having to share a table with people you don't know!  We were seating with 3 other people, making us a table of 6.  I noticed some people were able to have their own table, but it wasn't like that for everyone who came in!  They're quick there, so when you sit down, start looking at the menu, figure out what you want and order!  Or at least order your drinks and by the time they come back, know what you want!  The soup dumplings are out of this world, delicious! We shared and probably should of just ordered our own pot for each of us.  We ordered Beef and Broccoli and General Tso's chicken, OMG, I could eat here everyday and order something different and be happy with how it tastes, just based off the 3 things we ordered.  

Also, they DO NOT accept credit cards, so make sure you carry cash!"
"I have been there few times already and I LOVE IT, everything is so good, they serve fast and its cheap! I usually get sesame chicken, spring rolls and dumpling soup. You must go to this place when visiting NYC."
"We were a party of six for lunch and had to wait about ten minutes for a table but it was worth the wait just for the soup dumplings. They were scrumptious! We also had fried rice, tofu and vegetables and Gen Tso's Chicken-- all delicious."
"If you've never been, its worth going but just lower your expectations when it comes to friendly service - I have yet to see a smile and this was our 8th visit. Like many people we go for their Pork Steam Buns (dumplings with broth inside) they are very tasty and we usually share a serve of 8 along with a serve of the Shanghai Fried Rice which is delicious, that's plenty for us to share for lunch. (we previously have also eaten the kung pao chicken and moo shu pork - also nice). Average wait time to receive food; no frills look and feel restaurant and sometimes you are placed on large share tables with others - we try to get there around 10.30am before opening at 11am to get a single two person table, as well as to avoid queues."
"Thursday evening there was a line up of about 50 minutes, but it was pleasant because we went to a bar around the corner and had a quiet drink. By the time we got back the table was ready. 
The crowded round tables shared by different groups of people was part of the charm. The menu was easy to read. 
Best dishes:
Crispy shredded Beef
General Tso's chicken
Soup Dumplings 
Service was swift and prices reasonable."
Went for lunch last Friday. Outstanding steamed Dumplings! A meal in itself! Their fried rice is heavenly. Best anywhere. Had general Tso chicken and house specialty fried beef strips in orange sauce. Wonderful! This is really good fresh food. Best Chinese food ever. Bring cash. Don't take credit cards. 😊 You will not be disappointed😝
"During our grandson's recent visit to the City, he asked us to take him to Chinatown which always means a trip to Joe's Shanghai.  We arrived on Saturday around noon and there was already a line outside, but we only waited about 10 minutes before being seated at one of their shared tables.  It's always fun to talk with folks with whom you're seated and see what they're eating and we've never had an unpleasant experience in that regard. We ordered two steamers full of their signature crab & pork soup dumplings, some string beans Szechuan style (sauteed lightly with bits of pork and rock salt), delicious sesame chicken and a huge mound of pork fried rice.  Despite our past knowledge of the menu and the portions, we again over-ordered because we always want to try several different dishes. Everything was uniformly well-seasoned, hot and delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable and, while it's a popular spot with tourists, there are almost always an equal number of Chinatown residents as well -- to me the sign of a good restaurant."
"I read TA reviews regarding restaurants close to my hotel, and decided to have dinner here. Without TA I would not have chosen this place, I am glad I did! I have been to China a few times, and in my opinion this is quite authentic restaurant. 

I had delicious dumplings, and Kung Po -chicken. Both came to the table very hot. Those + Tsingtao-beer approx 30$.  Big portions, but I was very hungry... 

The restaurant was almost empty (approx 5 pm), and service was very quick, but not friendly (again, authentic...)."
"My mother and I had a delicious lunch at Joe's Shanghai. We had two portions of dumplings (each portion has eight pieces) and a crispy duck. The dumplings were absolutely unique, they tasted so good that we finished them all even if we did not expect them to be so many and so rich. 
We also were given some typical hot Chinese tea while waiting for the food to be cooked. The service was fast and prices were lower than they usually are in New York City.
The restaurant is perfect for lunch if you are visiting Chinatown: the local is not elegant and not quiet but still we really enjoyed the food!"
"We were steered here by Trip Advisor and were not let down. The prices were reasonable enough with 15% tip included. Portions were large and none of the four of us were able to finish our plates. We had a wide variety of dishes and the fish was outstanding. Despite asking for my dish to be extra spicy, it was fairly bland but still good. Communal dining was a little odd at first but we all got used to it quickly."
"Think they were as good if not better than Din Tai fang. The vegetarian options were good. Staff efficient, we went for lunch on a weekday at 3 pm and we're lucky to get a table, it was so full."
Joe's Shanghai is the spot for soup dumplings in NYC. It's famous and you can expect a pretty long wait at times. I prefer The Bao but Joe's is very good and definitely a place to visit a least once or to take friends/family from out of town who enjoy soup dumplings.
"I read about this restaurant so thought we'd pop in while we were walking around Chinatown. It was an experience in itself! We were seated at a table for 6 (where the other 4 were already dining) but it was a fun way to meet people and observe what others were ordering. EVERYONE was eating the steamed dumplings - luckily the others at our table showed us the right way to eat them (take a tiny bite, slurp the soup out, then eat the dumpling). Fun experience - delicious food. Give it a try!"
"Kung Pao is supposed to be spicy, but this dish was quite mild.  Good, but mild.  The dumplings are well made, but the spring rolls should be egg rolls and the szechuan should be spicier."
"Went with my partner and paid $36. Portions are sizeable. Communal dining - we sat with a family from Atlanta, Georgia. Also it's cash only.
Would definitely go again."
"Arrived and came especially for the soup dumplings. Definitely see and understand all the hype!! Shocked that you get 9 of them as an appetizer - this would have been enough as a main!
Unfortunately the time I arrived it was super busy and the restaurant sat about 5 different couples on the one table which wasn't so enjoyable. Good that they organised this so they could cater for more people but I would have preferred my own table. 
We also ordered some fried noodles and a beef dish, expecting ""normal"" sized portion, but both dishes were huge!! It's a shame not knowing how big the dishes were as we definitely would not have ordered so much (so much being 2 dishes for our main after the soup dumplings) - so much of it went to waste which was disheartening.
It was a good experience but one which I had better hopes for. The 3/5 is purely for the soup dumplings. Service felt hectic - waiter kept rushing us for our order as it was busy, which I didn't like at all. Uncomfortable atmosphere and setting."
We had some the best soup dumplings here while passing through China Town.  We shared 2 orders among 5 of us.
"We came for lunch here based on the good TripAdvisor reviews. What a disappointment! The service was terrible. All of the waiters are indifferent and slightly rude. Be aware that they only accept cash, no credit cards. They also include a 15% tip in everyone's bill. The portions are very large so two people could probably share one dish. The food was below average as Chinese cuisine goes. One can find better Chinese food in any suburb of any city in America... no need to come to NY city's Chinatown for good Chinese. If this is the best they have in Chinatown, yikes! It seemed more like a tourist trap. Definitely skip this one."
This is the spot for your soup dumpling fix!!   Just don't bite into it when they first bring it because they are hot!! Fast service as well!!
"This is my first time to be here, but the food and service are really impressed me. The food are delicious and hot, and even the waiter service attitude and the food recommendations are good too. I highly recommend to order pork knuckle, it is so soft and tasty. The siu lung bao are so nice too."
"The first time that I went there. Its not that full and i saw the chinese cooks working together, making the dumpling in the dinning table and it was awesome. They're making the dumpling fresh at all time. But im not sure about the sanitation tho haha ✌️best dumpling that ive ever eat so far 😁

One thing. Some of the staff are noisy and its like they are shouting each other? They were just talking normally, maybe its just part of their culture 😁"
"Of course you come for soup dumplings. They call them ""pork steamed buns"" on the menu, which threw me off a little because that's the description of a Char Siu Bao to me. Don't forget to let them cool down a bit before you pop the whole thing in your mouth. Also enjoyed the cold noodles with sesame sauce, sliced chicken with mixed vegetables, and shredded beef. I wish my traveling companions loved Chinese food as much as I do, as we would have returned time and time again. The restaurant is small, crowded, dark, and a little dingy. Some random woman sat down at our table for her meal, which threw us off too. But the service is good and the food fantastic."
"Went here after seeing Freedom Tower. Easy walk from there. Wish I seen Emerald and Mario Lagasi 'a food special on ""the best Shanghi Dumplings ""on amazon prime before going here. You need to know how to eat these Huge delicious Dumplings before you go. Otherwise you will burn your tongue and have it all over your shirt before you leave. I'll be ready next time! Excellent food. I had General Tso chicken which was excellent. Just take cash. Definitely going back next time in Chinatown."
"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything!  Sooo... if you don't like authentic Chinese food, this is not the place for you (you won't find sweet and sour pork on this menu;  think fish head salad and whole carp, instead!). The Sesame Chicken was very good, but the soup dumplings and vegetable fried rice were not what we were expecting.  The portions are huge;  at our urging, the other six people seated with us (whom we did not know) enjoyed sampling our entrees, so the food didn't go to waste.  Our waiter was not happy when we asked for forks!  It was a definite cultural experience,  but I wouldn't go back!"
"I waited in line for this restaurant for almost 2 hours (ridiculous, I know). It's a hole-in-the-wall but TOTALLY worth it. I like Chinese food, but it's not my absolute favorite. But, if I were a local - I would try to come here all the time. Definitely get the dumplings!"
"We dined here on a Saturday afternoon and the experience was very good.  Our wait was only 15 minutes and that was around 12:30 pm.  They seat you at a large circular table that may have others who are not in your party.  But the 2 times I've been here, the neighbors at the table have been very friendly.  The food is absolutely delicious and the prices are reasonable and the service is fast. We had the pork & crab buns (I wish I had some with me now), wonton soup (huge portion), general Tso chicken, & one other chicken and vegetable dish (the veggies were cooked perfectly).  You want to dine here because you will leave very satisfied."
"We always head to Joe's on our visits to NYC, yes it's crowded, yes, communal dining, but super great pork buns (soup dumplings) and the other dishes are just fantastic.  Bring cash."
"I'd like to give them 4.5 stars lol. Understanding all cultures are different, some of the staff here seemed rude. I think it's just the culture. Imagine, Chinese people yelling out ""numba tree!"" With heavy accent and no poise whatsoever. Again, cultural differences. Didn't bother me tooooo much, but definitely not used to it. The place is CASH ONLY so make sure you have paper! The place is small and extra crowded. They even sit you with strangers at the same table. No, not like hibachi. They literally sit you at a table meant for 4 with people you don't know. Sister and I didn't mind too much. We even offered the couple in our table to take their picture for them.  We ordered the pork soup dumplings as recommended by a friend who's obsessed with this place.  They were tasty and worth the hype. Yum! Then we ordered fried rice and kung pao chicken. Very yummy. The portions are big so beware. We had enough for 3 people, maybe even 4.  The bill came back $35. Super inexpensive!  I'd definitely come back! Not fancy, not spacious, tight quarters and a little warm, but great food and fulfills its purpose, to feed your soul!"
"if there's a must do if you´re a newbie in the Big Apple, i definitely recommend the whole experience of getting to Chinatown and look for this amazing place to understand what´s the meaning of sitting with a bunch of strangers that are enjoying the food as you are! going through the main dishes and specially the SOUP DUMPLINGS, you start sharing you´re experience with the others, the flavors and the textures of the plates are awesome so at the end you finish with the food, with a great experience and with new friends... 

without thinking it so much if you're coming to town you have to stop here and try this experience!!!"
Soup in the pork dumpling?  Amazing and fantastic!  The pickled cabbage is awesome!  All dishes ordered for party of seven disappeared within 30 minutes.  The wait was definitely worth it!
"We ate at Joe's Shanghai last night with another couple. The steamed dumplings were excellent. The Sesame Chicken was superb. The chicken and shrimp in plum sauce was good, not great. The fried rice with pork was very good. All of that being said, there are several things to consider. First of all, they put the 4 of us at a table for 8, and then added people we didn't know to the table. That was okay, but just don't expect to have a very private dinner. Secondly, the waiters took our plates away before we were even done using them, and while some of the people in our group were still eating that course. I was annoyed by that. Once we were barely done drinking our tea at the end of the meal, and while we still had fresh oranges that we never even got to eat at the table, they started giving us the bill and pressuring us to leave so others could have the table. Nobody says thank you, nobody is friendly other than the patrons. They whisk you in and rush you out. Two of the waiters were actually arguing in front of us, standing right next to our table. So, although the food was very good, the rushing and rudeness bothered me and I would just as soon go someplace else where we could have a more intimate setting and not be pressured to leave before we are even done! Still, I must admit despite my annoyance, I have never had better dumplings in my whole life!"
"We were strolling by Chinatown this weekend so decided to check this place out as it came out right on top on Yelp.
We ordered the usual suspects - going by all the rave reviews here; soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and pan fried noodles.

Soup dumplings were delicious and worth all the hype, the scallion pancakes were even better taste wise, however, a tad oily. Same with the noodles too, tasted well except the oil again. Going only by the food, I would've given them 4 stars.
But - the service! How can I forget that - all the reviews below are quite accurate in describing the horrendous service. The waiter glares at you scornfully as if daring you to ask for anything except the specific order. When I asked for a fork he mumbled something in Chinese which I couldn't understand.
Again, when we asked for the check and presented a card he shouted ""NO CARD, ONLY CASH"" as if we had committed a grave error. And while returning the change he conveniently retained the bill (perhaps to hide the auto deducted 15% service charge hoping we wouldn't see it and tip him again), and when we asked to be provided with the bill he AGAIN mumbled something in Chinese pretty scornfully and grudgingly got us our bill.

Phew, not sure I would want to return for this kind of service again!
Maybe get something to go if you really have to."
"I'll start off by saying the soup dumplings, which is the main reason we visited this restaurant were good and priced fair...Unfortunately the untrained and not so welcoming  staff did not make this a pleasant visit. The food is not good enough for my wife and I to revisit this restaurant and have to deal with the waitstaff."
"I visited last Sunday with family, based on good reviews on trip advisor. Well it was very disappointing! Service was horrible, with tip already included in bill which is why I think they don't care about customer service. Food was mediocre definitely not worth a trip to the city. Soup dumplings were more like an oily broth than soup. The place itself seemed dirty and very old. We also ordered general tsao which was ok but served with plain boiled broccoli. Crispy shredded beef tasted like uncooked flour with too sweet sauce and orange. Chicken and broccoli was the only meal that was decent. Fried rice is separate. All meals were large portions but that doesn't matter when you don't want to eat it."
"Great food, their Xiao Long Bao's are a little pricey compared to other places but worth it. Totally recommend to anyone who wants authentic soup dumplings"
THE best Xiaolongbao I have ever had and for so cheap. A must try if you are in NY or any of the other shops in the world.
"This place was hopping. Obviously a favorite by many. I went with 3 friends. 
We started with some adult beverages. Cold sparkling sake was not dry nor sweet. It was smooth and refreshing. The blood orange Cosmo was strong and very delicious. The ginger martini was really yummy. 
For appetizers we ordered soup dumplings which were a new experience for us. They were really great. The scallion pancake was amazing. 
Each of us ordered an entree and didn't realize that they brought it all out family style. Everything was incredible and portions were huge. We ordered orange chicken, shrimp and chicken, scallops, chicken with broccoli, and shrimp fried rice. My favorite was the orange chicken. It was crispy and a little spicy. 
The service was phenomenal. We didn't have just one server. So many people were constantly coming and going bringing food and drinks, and taking away finished plates and such. 
They also took care to space out our courses, which was much appreciated. And didn't rush us when we ordered another round of drinks after finishing our meal. I will definitely go back next time I'm in NYC."
"We are fairly regular in China town and often end up at 4-5-6, so we tried Joe's this time.  The place is a little small but well done, with good service.  We just had Dim Sum this time but it was well done and definitely will go back."
"Dumplings were delicious if tricky to eat - we should have let them cool down a bit first. 
Main course was very generous and also really good. 
Would definitely recommend this restaurant. 
We were lucky to get a table as we hadn't booked so if you were a larger party I would try to reserve a table."
"Awesome soup dumplings. Me and my friends down them by the dozens. 3 locations in NYC, Chinatown, midtown & queens.  The food is pretty good too."
"This is by far our favorite restaurant in China Town. One of the things that makes is so special is their soup dumplings. I believe that they are more properly called steamed buns, but that does not do them justice. Ask for pork soup dumplings and you are in for a real treat. A bowl of largish steamed wontons arrive at your table. Put one on your soup spoon, poke it gently with a chopstick, enough to release some of the steam and give you access to the soup inside. Then sip and savor and lastly eat the rest of the dumpling. These are so delicious you could make a meal just of them. But we also had chicken and vegetables and a sesame beef dish. Oh so good. For our family this is now the only place to eat in China Town New York."
"Been here a few times the food is very good you eat with other  people it's a Chinatown experience
 Lo mein is great sesame chicken is typically good spring rolls are good dumplings if you like are good scallion pancakes are good 
 Where is the duck sauce
Plan on waiting"
"Na  verdade o restaurante que fomos se localiza na 57 th street entre 5 • e 6 ° av .é um restarurante simples comida excelente  saborossiskma e farta .comemos um gyosa no vapor carne de porco apimentada e costeleta  agridoce! O preço é bom atendimento rápido eficiente!o pauzinho chines é diferentes liso preto foi dificil de comer com ele.

Actually the restaraunt was at 57 th street between 5 ° and 6° av .It's simple but excellent food tasty and  one plate serve 2 dependingon the hungry... we ate the gyosa , spicy porc and , sweet and sour porc ribs .the price was good .the're very efficient and nice. The chinese stick was different black  and thin itwas difficult to atr with them ....but you can ask the knife and fork."
"Our family visited Joe's Shanghai for a Chinese Restaurant visited by locals from Chinatown.  This is not your typical Chinese restaurant marketed to American culture.  We waited in the street until pur numbers were called and sat together with others, both locals and guests in tables of 10 or 11 people.  No private dining and no silverware here... but that is really alright.  Our family members had gone here before and served as our guides in this experience.  We ordered soup dumplings - not to be missed.  You might need to learn how to eat them by watching others. Yummy.  The meal was very good.  Dress casually and enjoy a don't miss evening."
"I am known to be a bit of a Shanghai dumpling lover so the thought of Joe's got me a bit excited.   Visited on a Friday lunch and got seated straight away though it was almost full.

It is a bit of communal seating but don't let that put you off.  The food is fantastic.  The dumplings were exquisite, genuinely divine, but saying that we ordered a large selection all of which was mighty fine!

If having Chinese in New York and want the china town experience with quality food then Joe's is for you."
"Okay. Wait out in a backstreet in Chinatown for your name to be called. You are then seated somewhat randomly at a table which you share with other guests.There is a full menu but most are there for the soup dumplings which are about as big as a peach and have a doughlike exterior which you puncture and suck out the very hot soup and then savor the dumpling and its pork and crab meatball center. Pay cash only and leave with a full stomach and a good deal. Not for everyone as this place is the antithesis of elegance, so leave your stuffy friends at home. I love it."
"We came back to So Joe's shanghai today which is where our first date  with love of my life 1999 May 1  
Than I was still living Upper West side of Manhattan Studio apartment by myself. He came with green Nissan pathfinder （I called the green horse) rescue me from the big jungle called Manhattan which is  I was almost drown and sank to this Manhattan  island .Happily Ever after.since that magical day with this wonderful man going to be 18 years on next Monday , I am so grateful for god found me this wonderful men , I couldn't imagine life without him !! Happy 18 the food is amazing"
"From a lot to choose, this Chinese restaurant is the one to pick either if you are vegetarian or not, they have many dishes to fulfill your tastebuds cravings. It's been there many years and despite plenty of other typical Chinese restaurants (fancier, newer, updated or easy to get to) this one keeps the good food quality and fast service (and reasonable prices).
A good experience!"
"It's a great place to dim sum and cheap prices, but bad Service. It was kind of funny how they gave service. Even so we have a great time and good dumplings."
"Great experience with my 2 kids (9 & 7) for their first meal in Chinatown. They loved the dumplings, fried rice, pork with vegetables and crispy beef. And they loved the people and food watching on the table we shared with others! Well worth the 30 minute wait on the street!!"
"We had to wait 30 minutes for a table because there were so many customers. When we got a table we couldnt find the dim sum on the menu so we ordered dumplings that werent that good. They were very oily and didnt seem too fresh. Ive had much better dumplings elsewhere so I wouldnt recommend it here. 
For the main dishes we ordered chicken sweet&sour which was ok but nothing special and baby shrimps which had little taste and were generally not that good. 
I dont see what all the good reviews and the many customers see in this restaurant.
Maybe the dim sum would have been  good here (alot of people ordered them).
The service was like most chinese restaurants: efficient and neither friendly nor unfriendly.
Payment is cash only and they include a mandatory 15% tip in the bill."
"If you can find Joe's Shanghai on Pell Street, stop in for some dumplings.  I find them to be the best I've had in New York.  The restaurant itself is not fancy and you will likely be seated at a table with people you don't know, but it's not uncomfortable.  Everything I've eaten at Joe's has been wonderful.  The menu is extensive and the prices are very reasonable.  I try to get here every time I'm in New York.  Be advised, Joe's does not take credit cards.  This is not fine dining, but the food is fantastic."
"Amazing place to taste chinese food for a low price. Everything was very nice, dumplings overall.
Staff are not specially kind but despite this the food worths the visit"
"This is me and my boyfriends go to restaurant. We eat here at least once a week, simply because the food is delicious! The staff is also very nice and friendly. So if you need a nice Chinese restaurant in NYC. This is the place to be!!!"
"We went by here one day we wanted Chinese food, and had heard good things about their dumplings. And we were not disappointed - food was pretty good. The venue was a bit run down, and could do with a little TLC. But the staff were attentive and polite, and prices were OK."
"I have been back in the UK for two weeks now and cannot stop thinking about the crab Xiaolongbao. First, I will talk about the restaurant. Located in the heart of Chinatown, the restaurant was packed to the brim. We were told we would need to wait 30 minutes but luckily some people had disappeared and we got in after 5 minutes! For starter we had these delicious crab xiaolongbao. Usually back in the UK, we only have pork xiaolongbao as an option which I love completely but these crab xiaolongbao were just another level. There was a large number between me and my partner; the soup/meat proportion was perfect and the flavour exploded in my mouth; I'm getting more hungry just thinking about them! For main we had Twice Cooked pork and chili beef. These dishes too were absolutely gorgeous and the portions were huge. The Twice cooked pork is one of my favourites but this version was different with large mushrooms in it and big hunks of meat - so good! I beg you, please come to the UK and open a London branch so I can continue to enjoy your delicious food - definitely at least a reason to return to NYC."
"1. Beware of that their price is in the menu is not same. In the menu, the lunch special is $9.99 and then they charged me 12.$$ because I ate in the restaurant. They said the menu price is ""To Go"" price. I never had any restaurant that has different prices for ""To Go"" and ""Eat In,"" especially for the lunch special. In the menu, it is not clearly stated, too.

2. Their soup dumplings are cold. When they bring the dumpling in the bamboo steamer, I cannot see any steam out of steamer or from dumplings. Maybe they are very kind enough to cool them down to help customers not to burn their tongues."
These people are very efficient.  We were not kept waiting and everything was well done. tables are of 8 and you are seated with others because they try to fill every seat. Food was great.  Popular for a very good reason.
"We started with an order of pork soup dumplings. Each order has 8 pieces. These are bigger than the soup dumplings that I have had before. The wrapper is thin and delicate. The soup and pork filling are delicious. Though I had some difficulty eating them because of their size, it was worth the effort. These were the best soup dumplings that I have ever had.

For our main course, we had crispy duck and fried rice. The fried rice was good. Unfortunately, the duck was flavorless and dry. I wondered if it was merely reheated, not cooked fresh.

Service was quick and efficient. They need to be. There is normally a long line of people waiting to get in.

I would return if just for the soup dumplings. And I will definitely not order duck."
"-Arrived late Saturday afternoon, waited about 30 mins (table for 5).
-Cash only and tip is included in the bill.
-They fill the table so you may sit with people outside of your group.
-Service is a little chaotic, I think multiple waiters serve each table. 
-Restaurant is packed. 
-Felt a bit rushed, ask about drinks (not listed on the menu) & was told beer, wine or soda. 
-Food arrived quickly and our order was correct.
-Steamed dumplings are fantastic. I didn't even know I liked dumplings until trying them here. Really a good flavor to the broth. 
-Fried rice was good and flavorful. 
-Noticed they have a 'C' rating from the health board...wasn't super excited about that.
-
Overall the food is really good and inexpensive. I would go again and recommend it to others."
Where else can you eat for less than USD 10 per person ? Not too many places. Very good dumplings and Shanghai noodles. The only drawback is the waiting line to get a table
"One reason or another, our kids wanted to visit chinatown.  So we got off the subway at Canal Street and started walking around.  Saw the reviews on trip advisor and decided to check it out.

The place was crowded but we got seated immediately.  We shared a large round table with two other parties but basically the other parties didn't talk to us and we didn't talk to them.

Before we even got our tea, the waiter asked if we wanted the Xiao Long Bao.  Our son loves them so of course we ordered two sets.  Overall, the wrapper was too thick but the pork and sauce inside was above average.  Asking our 5 year old expert son, he said the Xiao Long Baos at Din Tai Fung are still better.

We also ordered the Salted Pork which unfortunately was a bit chewy.  The vegetable dish was ok.

Maybe we were expecting more since this ""is chinatown"" in NYC"
"I had dim sum with my family. Compared to what I've had in San Fran, this was just ok. Not bad, but not great. We shared a table with others, which I liked. It was good to see what others were having before we ordered."
"The place is a crowded hot mess but the food is really good when you do get it. The. XLB are great- just like Shanghai. The other dishes were all good, too."
"First trip to this yummy restaurant. Be prepared to sit with others, we were a party of 3 and sat at a table for 8. Everyone kept to themselves, service was effective t and quick, food was delicious."
"Joe Shanghi is an NYC must visit in my opinion.  We love the Chinatown location on Pell street.  Yes, cash only and you may sit with other people.  For us, that's all part of the tremendous experience.  Soup dumplings are so delicious but the pan fried pork dumplings melt in your mouth.  The Mid-town location on 56th is very nice too.  Same great food.  Ate at each location during the last several trips to the city.  Wouldn't be a trip to New York without dumplings from Joe Shanghi!"
"this is a very ""Chinese"" style restuarant.. seating is shared with others, no ""Combination plates"" everything is authentic and delisious... we ordered way too much but it was so good. wish we had ordered the dumplings but we got caught up in all that was going on, it was very busy..."
"CASH ONLY!! And tip included!! These were the things we didn't know when we had dinner her. Not a problem, just would have been a good thing to be aware of before sitting down. That said, it was YUMMY! Of course the soup dumplings were awesome! I've crispy beef was the best I've ever had. Note- the dining room is small-ish. You may end up sharing a table with strangers. Worth checking out!"
"one thing  to say DONT GO we were recommended this restaurant, when we go there  we were told about 20mins wait (outside ) place was busy so must be good(how wrong)
after 50/55mins waiting we got our table now starving and looking forward to our meal,starters ordered lol first thing on our table was a plate of fried rice no starters yet ?they came with our mains all dishes put down we had to ask what they were some were wrong.complained to the main person to say what a shambles it was. he was still smiling  when I had left.PLEASE PLEASE DONT GO"
We had a great dinner at Joe's Shanghai. They have really good menu with tasty Chinese dishes especially dumplings. Highly recommended!
"My favorite restaurant for soup dumplings anywhere.  Every time I come to New York I have to visit.  Business or pleasure.  This time I brought the family.  Everyone loved it as much as me.  32 pork soup dumplings between 6 of us and not one was left (and except for my 6-year old, our technique is flawless) 

And the rest of the menu is great too.  We had a yang chou fried rice, General Tso's chicken, salt and pepper prawns, spring rolls, and a crispy pork chop with pepper salt my wife's aunt ordered.  Wanted the crispy duck too but not enough mouths to add it to the order.  

Everything was top notch. I never leave here with an ounce of room.  If you don't like Joe's then you just don't like Chinese food and you shouldn't be here.  And if communal seating is weird or uncomfortable for you, go to the midtown location.  Me personally, I don't care who's at the table.  Unless they get between me and my soup dumplings, then someone's getting a chopstick in the eye."
"We had heard that Joe's Shanghai was the place to go while in Chinatown.  Hands down, best Chinese that I have ever had!! The Soup Dumplings are a must!!  Watch a tutorial first if you have never had soup dumplings.  I loved the atmosphere!  To add to the fun, it was Chinese New Year!"
"We absolutely loved the food and atmosphere at Joe's Shanghai. When we arrived we thought it was all full, but was seated at a huge round table together with 3 other parties. At first it seemed strange, with so many differtng groups at the same table - but it was quite interesting. We had the signature soup dumplings and a beef chop suy. Best chinese food we've ever had. Will absolutely come back again!"
"I really liked the many dishes we ordered. Dumplings, shrimp, duck , noodles. I would not order noodles again but all the rest was fantastic. Prices were low. For NYC it was a gift. I will visit this place again on my next visit."
Had dinner in anticipation of Chinese New Year.  When we sat down the waiter asked immediately if we wanted the dumplings.  We said yes and they were the soup dumplings -- they 8 of them to an order and they were very good.  We then had twice cooked pork and string beans -- both of which were quite good. The service was fast and the food both hot and tasty.  Definitely can recommend.
"We stop in here whenever we are in NYC. We love the soup dumplings! Every entree we've ever had is great. They don't take Credit cards, so bring cash. You sit at large tables with other people, which can be fun. Worth the wait. Lunch is easier to get a seat."
"When you walk down the Chinatown street/alley to Joes and thru the door it really seems like you are in China. The hustle and bustle, a little noisy.  Only the clientele who are mostly 20's-30's are different. The food was very good especially the duck, General Taso chicken and the boc choi. The prices are very reasonable."
"I've visited Joe's Shanghai again after so many times and I have to say they are very consistent. But I get frustrated by some of the poor reviews just because ""they only accept cash"" or ""they sit us with another group in the same table"". These are no reason for poor reviews just because that's the way they historically operate. So if you don't like to pay cash ""don't go"" or if you don't like to be seated with someone else ""don't go'. Is their system.... 

They are consistently good on the dumpling's, in this visit I tried their Shrimp fried rice and the Braised Duck, all good."
"We went for a quick meal during a convention.
The place is crowded, you will wait a little but the experience is quite nice.

The food is quite well prepared and spicy. But balanced.

A lot of employees ensuring a fast service. 

I recommend and will repeat."
most famous for it's soup dumplings and we had it. It was one of it's kind and also the wonderful dining experience that one gets to share the table with strangers and eat together with higher chances of becoming friends at the end. The restroom waiting area is just too uncomfortable though. Rest of the food is average.
"The food was excellent - in particular, the  steamed dumplings.when i visit new york  i alwys eat at joes shanghai"
"One of the nicest Chinese restaurants in NYC 15-20 year ago has been ""discovered"".
Hordes of tourists eating mediocre food. We were a company of three adults and two small children, yet offered food with clams that had long expired and tasted very much so. We complained and all they did was to not charge us for that dish ! Too bad for the place it used to be."
"Our meals were excellent we really wanted to taste authentic NYC Chinese food and Joe delivered.

We arrived right around 5pm and had a 20 minute wait the wait just grew as we waited. Make sure you go inside and grab a ticket don't just wait outside.  Joes was the only restaurant packed with dinners.

The restaurant is small and you will be seated with others but this keeps the wait times down.

Little Italy is one block down we went for a walk there after dinner and had a cannoli."
"I wish I had read the Trip Advisor reviews before going here on the recommendation of a coworker.  The food was good, but not very good.  The service was the WORST - not one employee there had any customer focus at all. And the wait time was ridiculously long.  When we arrived we were asked how many in our party (2), given a number and told to wait outside.  About 20 minutes later, we were called in, and without a word, the hostess took us over to a round of 10 with 8 people already seated and dining.  She got a resounding NO from me.  What an embarrassment - she should have asked us if that would be OK.  So she told us we would have to wait even longer.  The total wait was more than an hour.

Our sullen waiter was no nicer than the hostess. He treated us as though he was doing us a big favor.  It took forever just to get water, and even though, right off the bat, we asked for forks, food began to arrive and he still had not brought the forks.  He NEVER came back to the table to ask if everything was OK - and he was totally unavailable when he was not doing anything, preferring to stand at the back of the place staring glumly at the dining room.  We waited a very long time for the check.

The soup dumplings were good and the entrees were just OK.  If you come here and there is no wait (good luck with that), then go on in for a so so lunch (you've been warned) - otherwise go anywhere else - it's not worth the time.

They only accept cash, which in this day and age is UNHEARD of.  You KNOW they have gotten comments and complaints about this!  But true to what we experienced, they just don't care about customers or their convenience. Same goes for the communal seating - some people will be fine with that, maybe it's fun - but it's not for everyone.  Again, it's to maximize seating, better for the management.  They should get rid of those rounds of 10 - they take up too much room for the number of people they seat."
"Upon completion of a Walking Tour in mid-December 2016, the guide recommended Joe's Shanghai, particularly for their soup dumplings, a unique treat that has the soup trapped inside a dumpling.  Sloppy to eat, but good.  We were part of a community table with 3 other groups.  The menu was large and the atmosphere was New York - loud, busy and a lot of fun.  We ordered the pork lo mein, but wished we had opted for the shrimp and broccoli , which looked great.  

Plan for a good meal, served fast.  Don not be intimidated by the crowd, as the seats turnover fast.  A nice way yo break-up the day."
The soup dumpling are very good and sitting with other people is actually a great experience. However it does not worth to wait more than 1 hour in the cold to have a seat.
"I go for dumplings every time I find myself in NYC (sometimes more than once). It is my favourite restaurant. The servers do not speak good English but it is usually a given that most people are there for the soup dumplings (why order anything else??). I've sat alone and I've sat at large group tables. It is not a place for a long leisurely meal. You order, you eat your dumplings, and you leave."
"Another place that has their service down pat. We arrived just as they opened on a Saturday morning and waited in queue. We shared a table of six with two other out of town couples and eventually shared our food as well. They will pack the restaurant to capacity, but have found a great efficient system of doing so. Service was quick and friendly. We ordered the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and fried bean curd. The bean curd was tasty but not really what I expected, my own fault. Scallion pancakes were too greasy, but had a great flavor. 

Soup dumplings were the highlight of the meal. Hot and steamy, plenty of soup inside. The wrapper to contents ratio was on point, but I felt the appearance was a bit lacking. They looked a bit too baggy and large in my opinion, because I was expecting a smaller dumping, one that can be enjoyed in one mouthful. Tasted great though!"
"My wife and two daughters & I celebrated a Chinese meal before going to Time Square last night on New Year's Eve.

The Dim Sum(Chinese Ravioli) was as advertised - delicious.

Only a few of the servers speak quality English and our main server did a poor job of answering questions which made it more difficult to order.  Especially if you have any special requests or food allergies.

We sat at a table with two other parties and luckily in our situation the other guests seated with us were very mannerly and quiet---I could see this as a luck of the draw where one never knows how the other guests can influence the ambiance of the evening?

Our main dishes were all done well and were all a bit on the oily side.  Service was speedy and each dish was brought out as finished so there was a staggering of when we ate.

The decor and ambiance were authentic, tired, and a bit rushed.

We each ordered a drink and with tip our total cost was $86.00."
"I think my favorite part of this restaurant was waiting for a table. Yes, we had to stand outside for a good 45 minutes, but it was laughable and an overall experience within itself. When we walked up, we were handed a ticket with a number on it. The greeter wrote our name on her clipboard with the number in our party (3). About every 10 minutes, she would come out to call out the numbers on her board to make sure that, if you were waiting, no one disappeared from your party or she would take you off the list. It reminded me of the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld! Once we finally got in, we were sat at a big round table with 7 other strangers, which made it interesting. We chatted with visitors from Germany and a few local New Yorkers. The food was good, not out of this world, but you must get the soup dumplings if you go. (They are in the picture of the restaurant.) We eat dumplings all the time but these are more like soup and dumplings all-in-one. The restaurant is small, but, again, it's more of an overall experience than it is a fine dining choice. We enjoyed it."
"I'm a big fan of dim sum and decided to give this place a try based on the shanghai (soup) dumplings reviews.

We collected a ticket and had only about a 10 minutes wait to get inside the restaurant. You sit at shared tables which is fine and gives the place a bit of bustle. 

I went for the beef soup dumplings which were very nice - probably couldn't eat a lot of them though but worth trying nonetheless! I mistakenly ordered a main as well which was a bit much for one person but would have been worth sharing. 

Service and setting was pretty average - obviously designed for a fast turnaround with no frills attached. 

Worth going for the dumplings."
"Very long wait, took twice . Soupy dumplings are good, most of the other fare average. Community tables fun, service average as well."
"Sitting around circular tables, the staple of large banquet style dinners in China but this time with strangers and no formality, we enjoyed Joes soup dumplings immensely. Their sesame noodles were also yummy. Just as good as in Shanghai. This place was hopping at lunch time so expect a short wait. Worth it though. I'd go back again."
Yum! Such a fun place to eat lunch while visiting Chinatown! The soup dumplings are SO good!! We just stopped in for those alone and they were worth the trip!! They do just sit you at a random table with strangers though. That didn't bother us- still a great experience!
We had fun time.  The atmospere is the great and we sat with some fun people.  They do not take reservations and we waited 30 min. for a table.  It is a family style place and you sit around round tables with other people.  The food was good.  The dumplings were really good. The main courses were good also.  But not really anything over the top.
"one of the best dumplings in New York (soup pork dumplings). Probably you are going to be sit with random people on the same table, that is kind of funny."
We came here based on a recommendation. It is on a quiet small street off Mott street which is the main area of China town. It is amazing to see the lineup on a Monday night and this is the only one with the lineup. We had the soup dumplings which is a very filling appetizer at only $6.25 for 8 dumplings. The vegetarian mixed vegetables has the tastiest broccoli and snow peas with Chinese mushrooms at $11.25. The fried chicken with lemon sauce is tender and not covered with any thick batter. I like that the sauce is in a separate bowl. The bill comes with a 15% gratuity and tax automatically. There is at least a 20 to 30 minutes wait regardless of when you come and be prepared to share a table. It is worth the wait and it is good value for great food.
This place was exactly what we wanted.  Excellent food and great authentic atmosphere.  Busy but not too busy. You will set at a big round table with other guests. But don't let that deter you. Everyone is focused on the food. Soupy dumplings were great. Would definitely go back again.  Thanks Joe's!
"Have been here a few times over the last 10 yrs.  Has not changed.  Still super delicious soup dumplings, which is the reason that most people come.  Not too many asians eating here, so that tells you something.  Prices are good.  They have large round communal tables ,so if you don't like sitting with strangers, may not be your vibe.Crowded and lots of phrenetic energy, so do go hoping for a quiet romantic meal."
"Excellent food. Well prepared and served.
We went in for lunch and were fortunate to get a seat soon. Guests were made to share tables, as place opened up.
Pork Fried Dumplings and Crab dumplings - 8 per basket - were outstanding! Served very hot straight from the frying pan. Kung Pao Chicken was good too.
Large portions so order with caution."
"You have never had dumplings like these!! The soup dumpling is amazing! Anything you order here is incredible.
Try a few things you are unfamiliar with, you will be happy you did.  
This restaurant is a little out of the way and hard to find, but so worth the effort.  My friends and I love it!"
"You ever had a dumpling SPLASH at you?  NO!?!? You gotta try Joe's Soupy Dumpling.  Either the regular or the one with crab meat.  Both DELICIOUS!!!!  Joe's sell other dishes....noodles, rice, soup, a la carte dishes.  BUT, you must try the soupy dumpling."
"We went here based on the high rating hype. The restaurant’s on a side street in Chinatown was difficult to locate using the online navigation provided. It was busy around late lunch time but there was no wait. We could tell all the customers were out of town tourists. Belatedly we found out they do not accept credit card so our menu selections were limited. We chose Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, aka Pork Steamed Buns (the main motivation of our visit) and String Bean, a typical Szechuan style vegetable dish.  The steamed dumplings were larger in size than the usual, dainty ones we had tasted elsewhere. After eating 2 orders of these, we concluded that they were excessively soupy (watch out for plenty hot liquid squirting out at first bite) and doughy. The string beans were average. Watch out: they automatically added a 15% service charge on the bill (for a party of 2) which seemed unusual to us."
"This restaurant came highly recommended as a place to sample excellent delicious, Chinese cuisine.

So a small group of us walked to the restaurant with great expectations of a night to savour.

Upon our arrival, it was immediately apparent that this was a popular haunt, to what appeared to be, predominantly students.

What's more, there was quite a queue of predominantly youngsters waiting for a available tables within the cramped restaurant. 

Now, normally, queues outside a restaurant are a good sign. But age of clientele says a lot, such as .... plenty of it and not too expensive!!

Alarm bells were ringing, but I persevered and we were eventually seated 'cheek by jowl!'.

We ordered our dishes, which included the legendary soup dumplings, the house speciality.

I'm not going to itemise our dishes, but what I will say is, the dishes were unusual, tasty in parts and interesting.

It will not be to everyone's taste, as each person has their favourite dishes and preferences for preparation and presentation.

My advice is to go on a less busy day so you can interrogate the waiter throughly about the dishes and what you might expect to emerge from the kitchen.

Bona-petite!!"
The four of us ordered 3 apps and 5 main courses with a noodle dish.  We finished everything. The food was fresh and perfectly prepared. I have never read had soup dumplings like the ones they serve and they were great. The beef with asparagus is to die for - just go!!!
"Get there early as the line goes right out the door. Before 6 is good. Just order the pork dumplings, they're amazing."
"Highly recommend this resutaurant for a real flavour of China town.  We visited saturday afternoon, qued for 25mins.  Food, service and atmosphere great fun.  We walked if off in the afternoon with a walk across Brooklyn Bridge and around Brooklyn, great way to spend the day.  Defintly recommend Dim Sum and Chilli beef"
"We had a great experience for lunch at Joe's Shanghai.  We only ordered the pork dumplings but they were delicious!  Most of the tables are large communal tables for 8 so if your a small group, be prepared to sit with other people.  Looking around the restaurant, and at our table, most people order the dumplings.  They are cheap (i think like $6 for 8 pork dumplings), delicious, and warm the soul on a cold day!  You must add this to your list if you are visiting Chinatown!"
"We went there on a Tuesday for lunch. Very basic but bustling place. You need to pay cash and they don't give you a lot time to order. But the food is amazingly authentic. We had a ""reversed"" pork dumpling soup. With the meat and the soup inside the dumpling. Extremely well seasoned and original. As a second dish we had prawns sweet sour crispy deep fried with an orange peel sauce. Was also great. Portions are huge so don't order too much."
I visited this restaurant 10 years ago.  I was amazed. I had the best dumplings better than Taiwan and China. But this place has gone down hill.  Service is sloppy and the dumplings skin is broken easy and the meat is dry.  No more next time
"It was all right.  The soup dumplings are the best things on offer, but a number of them came pre-popped.  The Shanghai noodles were so greasy they were nearly inedible.

The line is long and obviously filled with tourists.  You will most likely share a table with others (our companions included 3 adorable but loud and hyperactive children).  

The restaurant got a ""C"" rating from the health department (for those who don't know, that's nearing failing... ""A"" is the one you want).

To make things worse, a 15% service charge is automatically added.  Pay attention.  When we received our change, the receipt had disappeared so we were about to add more tip, before we realized the bill was higher than it should have been for just food and tax. 

You can do better in NYC."
"After a long walk outside, I really enjoyed warming up by eating some noodle with soup and xia long bao. Service is fast and very efficient. I enjoyed it so much that I took also some dishes to go.
I recommend the crab dumplings with soup in the dumplings!
I also liked that the price was service charge inclusive."
"From the moment we arrived to the time we left, this place was all go. It's not a spot for a casual, lazy lunch, but was good fun nonetheless. The staff were a bit direct, but good enough to stop us over-ordering, which we realised as the portion sizes are massive. Flavour was in abundance too and we left happy"
"If you're craving for Chinese food, this is the place to go when in NY. They serve delicious authentic Chinese food. We make it a point to dine here every time we go to NY.  The place is always full so you have to reserve ahead of time."
"Xiao lam bao (show lam bow) like in shower, or soup buns are the superb specialty of this restaurant and their version beats all of the many places where  we have sampled this dish. Order both versions, crab/pork and plain pork filled, $9.95/$8.95, 6 dumplings, perfectly made, steamed to order, served with a ginger-infused black vinegar sauce. The main caution is not to break the dumpling skin when transferring the buns to the spoon using your chopsticks, provided tongs, or fingers. With the bun in the spoon, nip off the tip of the bun  top so you can suck out the soup before eating the rest. I like to pour a teaspoon of the sauce down the hole into the hot soup first to cool it a bit, others put the sauce in the spoon, it's up to you. Six buns per steamer dish are filling, so we usually order one more entree, usually ma po tofu, to finish our meal. The Shanghai cuisine is very flavorful, most dishes are not spicy. Weekdays offer a budget lunch menu but it won't give you what makes Joe's Shanghai special. Get the buns!"
"We stumbled upon this place by being attracted to the menu posted on the window. It was crowded which is also promising. 

We had multiple orders of the soup dumplings, which were the best I've ever had, and I make it a point to eat soup dumplings whenever I can. 

The service was good, also. Next time I'm in the city, I'll be coming back here."
"Came to try the soup dumplings. Shared a table with other diners which is fine, but the whole place is very noisy and crowded. Staff service is not there, and the soup dumpling is overrated (maybe becos I'm Asian and I've tried better ones. I don't know if this could be the best you may find in America.) In any case it's not worth the wait. I was alone and waited 20 mins for a seat."
"Every time I walk past this place, it's busy. I would go more often but you have to allow time to get at table and get service. Like many others have said, it IS TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT for soup dumplings!"
"The choice of dishes is abundant. The variety of customers, too. Everything is hectic. Tea arrives within seconds, food arrives within a few minutes and is tasty. But once you'r about to finish, the next customer will almost fight for your seat and table. Nothing for a romantic tête-à-tête buth nevertheless a nice NYC experience."
"This place is popular and for good reason: those soup dumplings are amazing. 

If you show up at peak hours you're definitely going to have to wait but you know what? It's totally worth it. 

Everything was good but DAMN THOSE SOUP DUMPLINGS!

Also: be prepared to sit at a big table with a bunch of other people. That kinda thing doesn't bother me at all, but I figured some folks might appreciate the heads up about it."
"The place is so small, you need to share your table with other strangers and they don't take credit cards. That was not a problem for me. The waiters are not kind at all, it seems they are being forced to work there. The soup dumpling is indeed delicious but the other plates were just ok. On the average I would try to find another place to eat."
"There is a lot to love at this well known Chinese joint; great prices, huge portions and quick service.  Let's get fown to brass tacks, it's the soup dumplings you should be coming for.  They are the best you'll find this side of the world.

It's cash only, so.... bring cash.  And, come hungry."
Service is what you'd expect but food amazing! The dumplings were particularly good. Cash only though.
"Last year, I spent 4 days eating soup dumplings in Shanghai.  Our tour guide actually teased us about having a one track mind.  Joe's comes close, which is a huge compliment.  The dough is a tiny bit thicker but heck, I will have these rather than take a 15 hour flight for them."
"I was very impressed by this place. We had dumplings that were exceptional. For the entrees, we had Lion's Head (pork) and Chinese eggplant. Both dishes were served with and delicious with white steamed rice. The only downside is the restaurant only takes cash."
"Stopped for a late lunch/early dinner today. The place was packed, but we were seated pretty quickly.   We ordered eggplant in garlic sauce which had NO garlic in it, and crispy pepper duck which was certainly crispy without any pepper.  Both dishes OK.....just OK. The dumplings....fat, dripping with juice/soup, beyond delicious.  Lesson learned....dumpling, dumplings, dumplings."
"We arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday night and waited less than 15 minutes for this tasty, authentic china town experience! For a party of 3, we ordered the #1, #2 and Singapore Chow Mai Fun. Be aware that they seat smaller parties at the same big table! Otherwise WICKED fast service and delicious, hot pork soup dumplings! Can't beat the price, only the crowds! Fantastic no-fuss meal."
"This place was epic. The food was amazing. We had the whole fish, the pork dumplings and veggie fried rice. We were only 2, so they put you at a table with other people. It's communal style, which is kind of nice. Each meal comes with a good pot of green tea. The price is really good. Highly recommend for tourists looking for the best Chinese experience in town."
"A friend told us about this restaurant and we loved it. We took a taxi there (about $25 from Times Square), but took the subway back and it was only 3-4 blocks from the restaurant.  We went on a Saturday night and did not have reservations; I don't think they take them.  We waited about 20 minutes and they called us.  They have large tables and seat parties as they have openings.  There were 8 of us and we sat with 3 people who lived in NYC.  They suggested things off the menu and told us other good places to eat. Service was prompt and we ordered 6-7 dishes and shared them; everything was excellent.  There is a big lazy susan in the center of the table making it easy to share dishes.  You can order a range of beverages but they keep you well supplied with hot tea.  This was another fun place for a large group.  When the first three people left, they sat two more New Yorkers at out table and we learned a lot about NYC from them also.  At the end of the meal, our waiter brought a bowl of orange slices for us:)"
"We waited one hour to be seated for Sunday lunch/brunch. Once we got in we shared a round table with random people. 

Started with the soup dumplings then We ordered a ton of food! Highly recommend the scallops & shrimp in garlic sauce, young chow fried rice. 

It's definitely a China Town staple but it ain't worth the wait."
"We had read good things about this place both online and in our Guide Book. It was a little away from our Hotel so we jumped on the subway and eventually found it. After waiting in the melee outside for a few minutes we eventually worked out we had to get a ticket in order to be seated. After a few minutes our number was called and we were taken in where we were seated with a couple of other groups. Ordinarily this would not of been a problem however they had all been before and knew what they wanted so were able to order immediately whereas we had to rely on the Menu. After a few minutes perusing the menu we decided on one of the specials (the lemon chicken) and a noodle dish that we thought would be similar to Chow Mein. We were told the specials all came with rice and that the noodles were crispy which wasn't exactly what we wanted but as our table guests were nearly finishing their meals we went with it. The lemon chicken was the strangest I've ever had as it was coated in coconut which is an odd combination I don't intend on trying again. The crispy noodles were a nice surprise but could of done with more sauce. Both portions were huge. There was no rice! As we were late ordering this obviously upset the plans as more table guests came to join us as we were finishing. 
Also worth noting that this place was Cash Only. Luckily we overheard a waiter tell another party so we held off from a second drink as we might of been washing up."
"I almost swallow a piece of plastic bag that i found in my mouth while having my soup, i told the waiter and they only brought me another one, charging me anyway. DIRTIEST PLACE EVER"
"Saw the crowds and decided to try it.  Very good, authentic Chinese food.  Huge quantity.  Had to try the dumplings and they did not disappoint.  Their vegetable dishes all looked great.  Very reasonable, clean and efficient service.  WIsh we had time to and appetites to try more of their dishes."
"We found this place during our snow storm when most other restaurants were closed. We called and confirmed they would be open,and so we braved the snow and cold, but were utterly disappointed afterwards. We understood they were busy that night, and so were very patient waiting, but then we were offered to sit in a bigger table sharing with others, which we didn't like but reluctantly agreed. However, once we sat down, another table was about to be available and we offered to wait a little for this smaller table for three of us, but the management was very unhappy about this request somehow ?! They didn't want us to wait nearby, but when we tried to check with the customers to see how much longer we needed to wait before agreeing to sit at the shared table, the management became furious for no reasons! We eventually settled down in the small table after only a few minutes of waiting, but somehow the management was really pissed off ?! You could imagine the quality of the service with that kind of attitude, but what was most insulting was when we stood up and left, the manager was rushing to us for fear of us escaping without pay!! He was eventually stopped by his waiter as he knew we already paid for the meal and tips !!! This was the third time we dined there, but would be the last time I'm sure."
"I don't get why this place is all the rave. Yeah the food is good but it is far from outstanding. I've had better 'xiao long bao' dumplings elsewhere, the kinds that don't explode easily when you pick them up using chopsticks. The place is packed and noisy, and chances are, there will be a long wait and you'll be sharing tables with complete strangers. Service is a bit slow and our wait staff gave an angry look when we told him he got one of our orders wrong."
"This was a new experience for us. The restaurant was full and we had to wait a few minutes. Then we were called and sat in a big table with a group of unknown people. We ordered the pork and crab meat dumplings for appetizer and they were excellent. Then for the main entrée we got the duck. Fantastic. The service was prompt and efficient, the food was very good and the price inexpensive."
"As Chinatown has pretty much absorbed most of Soho finding Chinese food isn't all that hard. Finding the best Chinese is a little harder but making your way to Pell St is all you need to do to find Joe's and the best Chinese we've found anywhere. You'll wait to get in regardless of when you go but once you're in you'll be glad you waited. They're not much on atmosphere but it just feels authentic and ""sincere"".  We just had to try the soup dumplings and what a start!  The best yet. String beans were amazing and the crispy beef was knee buckling. Glad we were sitting down.  This is just one of those places one has to try."
"The steamed soup dumplings are always the best.
In order to have them at there best sometimes you may have to wait a little for them to be steamed.
Open up the top of the dumpling add some rice wine vinegar they give you, let cool off a little.
Be careful orbit will burn your mouth."
"Looks nothing from the outside but packed with locals, all of whom appear to start meals with the steamed dumplings. Magic and very reasonable too."
"Despite the fact the street looks empty, you will find this nice place to enjoy chinese food ! Service is a bit cold but food is great."
"This restaurant is well-known in Chinatown for their soup dumplings. Trust me they will not disappoint, however do not make the rookie move of putting the entire thing in your mouth because you will burn your tongue. There is a technique to eating the dumpling and of the soup without it pouring all over your plate, be sure to ask A veteran."
"After reading all the reviews on TA, I decided I had to try out the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai so I went solo for lunch. I placed an order for 1 steamer of soup dumplings and it arrived quickly. Dumplings were delicious and hot but hard to eat because they are relatively big so tricky to eat in one bite :) Prices are amazing! I will definitely be back."
"Food tastes fresh and delicious, you can tell they get great chef here. We always order soup dumplings to go with two different orders, I like the spicy pepper salt prawns(shell on) the most."
"Very nice, easy going Dumpling restaurant.
never mind the wait (at 22:00), never mind the noise, never mind the common sitting with a variety of other guests at the same table :) This place is the right place for soup dumplings! Just look around and do as others do. Do take care when eating the soup dumplings - it is hotter on the inside! :)"
"I was looking to have some good Chinese food while in Chinatown New York, and I found it. This place is a little hole in the wall, and even for a late lunch it was very busy. We had the chicken fried rice and General Tso's chicken. Both were really good. I would definitely recommend this place. Note: they only accept cash."
"Had a trip from a local yesterday while on a walking tour AND then my old college roommate (who used to live in NYC after college) told me about the exact same spot. Random. Serendipitous. When you get two recommendations you check it out.....

Great tea, lots of refills on water, huge fish tank...what more could I ask for? Pork soup dumplings to die for. A party in your mouth. Eating them is a bit tricky---do not be afraid of the chopsticks! Quick service. Unassuming storefront. In a back street of Chinatown. Simply the best! Highly recommend."
Even mid afternoon there was a line.  It was worth the wait.  The dumplings were tender and delicious.  We also had scallion pancakes and scallion rice which were out of this world.  Our favorite meal of our trip.
"When we lived in Bayside Queens 20+ years ago, we were regulars to the Flushing branch. Great Shanghainese style dim sum and dumpling. We came to NYC for a meeting last week and made an effort visiting their Chinatown location (main location) and the food was really not up to the bar. If I give Ding tai fong an A+, this place is a C- at best. We had the pen-fried dumpling, worse than pen-fried frizen dumpling. Thick skin, greasy and insufficient filling, there 8 in an order, we had one each and left 6 on the plate (didn't even bother to pack). We also order the Shiao Lon Bao, again super greasy and we couldn't finish them. I don't know how did all the ""great"" review came from on TripAdvisor but to us, it is a NEVER. Sorry."
"My girlfriend and I spent the week in NYC, hitting high end places, like Nobu.  She thought it would be fun to eat in Chinatown - someplace authentic.  Found Joe's on trip advisor and had a wonderful meal.  Be prepared for community seating but also make sure you order the Pork dumplings.  Pork w scallions was amazing also.  We made sure and did a repeat visit before returning home."
Love their soup dumplings. It is by far more superior than anyone out there. Almost every dish is very good.  The only draw back is that you are pretty much waiting outside and you would need to share your table (cramped) with others. But we still go because of the dumplings!
"When i saw this place had many reviews, I thought it would be worth a visit, how wrong we were. A cheap unhygienic restaurant that one should avoid. The food was absolutely
tasteless. The fried rice with prawns awful, the pork shoulder with spinach one should avoid that meal at all cost the stuffed crab and pork dumplings were basic. Not worth the money these guys should be ashamed of themselves for selling such nonsense."
Joes was by FAR the very best authentic Chinese food we've ever enjoyed. You have a patron for life ! Good Job Joe !!
"Unless you really really want to try the ""water dumpling""; it's not worth the wait. Lots of fish in the sea including a Szechuan joint across the street (no waiting).

Eating that soup dumpling is to risk a scalded tongue and broth on your shirt. I tried the General Tso, which was bland & gristled. The steamed rice was overcooked. The wait-staff was surly and the line for the bathroom snaked throughout the restaurant. Lovely. Hey Joe: add a john."
"Joe's was recommended by the staff at the hotel we were staying at, since we wanted to go to Chinatown and eat, but had no clue as to a restaurant to try. Very good food, very crowded. The wait was about 30 minutes and it was the only restaurant on the street with people waiting outside so it must be the best, right? The dumplings were wonderful, the fried rice was average. Cash only so come prepared!"
"Joe's on Pell St in Chinatown is a fairly small place with a family-style eating experience.  My family always orders the same thing when we go:  scallion pancakes, soup dumplings, and a side of green beans.  I'm telling you now, the soup dumplings are to die for.  It takes some maneuvering with the spoon and chopsticks, but they are so savory and delicious!  And don't let the green beans fool you, they may seem like such a simple side dish but however they are cooked just makes them absolutely mouthwatering!  Take a stroll through Chinatown when you're done.  So much fun and a must-visit place when in NYC"
"I spoke to a new yorker prior to travelling to NYC and she gave me a list of recommendations of great places to eat which tourists may not find on their trip and this was one of them. We went last night (07th) and had a fantastic time! 

What I enjoyed about it was not only how quick the food was, but the quality and taste of the dishes were phenominal. We ordered steamed pork buns for starters (8 per order) which were a good introduction to the meal. After finishing these, within a minute of our plate being taken, our main course arrived which was sesame chicken for myself and beef with orange sauce for my partner and both were absolutely delicious. 

The layout of the restaurant caters for couples and parties of people however due to popular demand id recommend getting in touch prior to arrival if parties exceed 4. What I enjoyed about the large tables with people sharing is that you're sharing your experience with those on your table rather than isolating yourself with tables of 2. Definitley recommend if you're visitng and want a taste as to what chinatown has to offer!"
"The best chinese restaurant in the world. The best soup dumplings I've ever tasted.
 Sometimes I think to return to New York just to go to Joe's Shangai."
"When i was invited to this Chinese restaurant, i was not impressed with the name nor the first look at the entry door.....once inside totally different.....AMAZING FOOD....when you see a majority of Chinese people eating there, it is easy to draw the conclusion that is a real thing....do not missed the famous soup dumplings"
By far one of our family's favorite restaurants...we make a point to come here at least twice....maybe three times every time we come to NYC...we only order the crabmeat soup dumplings...8 orders...for 5 people...note: the location in Chinatown gives you 8 dumplings/order...the location on 56th St gives you 6 dumplings/order...
Worth the thirty minute wait for a table. The dumplings are amazing and the tea is lovely. Very busy and fairly loud.
Visited there with my foodie niece. Wait of 20 minutes but went by quickly. Expect to be seated communal style like chairman Mao but be treated to quick service. Selection is good. The dumplings are excellent. We had the pork dumplings with Shanghai noodles. The noodles were average. Several of the dumplings stuck to the bottom from sitting too long before being served. Eating them is a skill as it was fun to watch people trying to race this task. If eaten whole risk of serious burn and loss ability to taste the rest of the meal or spillage on to your shirt. Service is spotty and they include a service charge. Cash only. Need to try once.
"I went to Joe's Shanghai with my girlfriend on a Sunday night. The place was packed and we had 30min wait, which it was not bad considering the crowd outside. You sit on a big table with other patrons and that's ok. Food comes fast and it's great. We had the famous soup dumplings and other dishes. Be careful with the dumplings, the temperature of the ""soup"" inside is the same as LAVA. Take it easy. Fun place, good price , great food. Will go back"
Many years ago. I said this is the number one dumpling in the world.    But this visit it's completely change.  The dumpling skin still very good.  But the juice and meat does not taste good   The cold chicken meat taste old.  I fee the owner has been working too long and no interest in his restaurant.  Also the service is not good either.   Many worker but very unorganized.
"I almost never go to NYC and not make a trip to Joe's for the soup dumplings. Simply awesome. It's crowded, and they pack you in, but it's worth it. If there is a wait, try Joe's Ginger just down the street.,"
"Our hotel recommended this restaurant, and as a huge fan of chinese food I thought it was the best chinese food I've ever had. The fried rice was delicious, portions are big. Went there twice!"
This place is  small. You will share t as bkes... community  style. The soup dumplings is a must. They have a wide variety of noodles. My favorite is the noodles  wirh spicy meat sauce. The fried dumpling is great too. Be prepared  to wait for your spot to eat.
"I come here whenever I'm in the city for work. I always try to come right when it opens as I've read the wait can get very long. Always seated right away, sometimes at a table for 2 with whoever I'm eating with, or we are placed at a community table, which is an added fun to this restaurant. We have always ordered both the pork and crab soup dumplings. Always so delicious!! I have to admit, most of the time the waiters make me feel rushed during my meal. I understand that this restaurant can get extremely crowded, but at times I feel as if I'm being watched. Nevertheless, the staff members are always very nice. And I will definitely keep returning!"
"I was in New York for 4 nights and had to visit this place at it serves some of my favourite food.  I would gladly fly across the pond to just eat here if I could afford it!

This is a no frills Chinese restaurant serving Shanghainese food which I understand has become trendy in the US.  I went on my own the first night as my OH was flying in the day after.  I had my own segment on a table of 8 and just wanted some noodles and wontons, the food was really good and portions were huge, the price was really reasonable too.  They now put the service charge on the cheque as some people weren't good at tipping properly according to the guy I was sat next to.

We visited again as a couple a couple of days later and I ended up sitting on the same table in the same spot with another group of friendly strangers.  We had the pork soup dumplings, the crispy pork chop with pepper salt (comes with a sweet and sour sauce in a separate bowl) and the Shanghai flat noodle.  Portions were huge again and easily fed the two of us and again at a reasonable price despite the weakness of sterling at the moment.

If you don't mind sharing tables with strangers, no tablecloths, having to get a raffle ticket to queue for a table and waiting around 30 minutes for a table and you like great food that is a bit different to the usual Chinese restaurants then it is definitely worth a visit.  Also whilst you are waiting for a table, go for a foot massage over the road, brilliant after a weekend pounding the streets."
"We just enjoyed a delicious Shanghainese lunch at Joe's.....pork soup dumplings , scallion pancakes and fried pork rice cakes....the dumplings were so juicy that we were slurping in delight. ...trying to see who could eat the dumplings best without the soup falling on your plate...I won.....everything was perfect......be prepared to share a table  with many groups..the waiters are good at making sure everyone gets what they ordered...it was crowded....turnover is quick....reasonable prices....tip included already....service was actually good for Chinatown. ..cant wait to go back to try regular dishes. .."
"Super crowded and I know why! Food is delicious, dim sum is a must try here. Portions are at least for two people!) and price will be nice. A rare place in NYC that incorporates all that!"
"I finally had a chance to introduce my parents to this restaurant along with a relative visiting from out of town. 
The crabmeat and pork soup dumplings are outstanding. We also had the scallops and prawns in garlic sauce and the beef fried rice cake. Both great choices. The baby bok choy and tofu with ground pork were nothing spectacular. 
It's also wallet friendly. Less than $100 for all four of us to eat and we had leftovers."
"Went to lunch for some authentic Chinese food and everything brought to the table was like we were in Shanghai.
The tea was wonderful, the food was authentic and home made, and the atmosphere was pure China! Action all around and never a dull moment. By the time we left there was a line out the door and down the block, that tells you all you need to know!
The dumplings were wonderful with a little bit of broth in each one. The diced chicken, crispy chicken, and Singapore Chow Main was all very good and we did not leave anything on the table.
A full lunch for four for $ 60 is a GREAT value and all the food was fresh!

Cant wait to be in the area again for another meal."
"I went with the family for vacation and walked around Chinatown where we discovered this place. 

It is a small place with a few tables and a long line of people waiting, but it is well organized, so the wait is not to much.

The pork buns are excellent and you can't miss them or otherwise you will loose your visit. 

My daughter ordered the seafood soup which was delicious. My son wanted a more traditional  so he asked for sesame chicken which was the best I ever tried.

For me, I asked the Szechuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup which was super. 

The only average dish was the chicken fried rice. 

Good service and reasonable prices."
"Fun, family style tables. Very good Chinese food.  We had the pot stickers and sesame chicken. Delicious! Wait staff is very attentive and efficient."
"Chinese soup dumplings are wonderful. Since there is soup inside the dumplings be aware how to eat them to avoid accidents. You have to hold a dumpling in a spoon, give a small bite and suck the soup , that is very hot and only then eat it slowly..
There is a very famous restaurant inside a n old monastery in Shanghai ,famous for their soup dumplings. It is so crowded that normally there is a long line . But for us Joe's Shanghai is as good as that place and it is closer..
Joe's Shanghai is also in Midtown, but the one in Chinatows is much better. It is normally very full ,but it is worthed to wait. Whenever I go to NY I go there.just love their dumplings. You can choose different fillings.one of the most famous is the crab one, if you like crab, but meat ones is also good. It is really a delicatessen ."
"I decided to try the dumplings of this restaurant as it is recommended by various guidebooks and considered it obtained good marks on Tripadvisor. I was pretty disappointed by the dumplings. Indeed, the lacked of flavor. It is not bad but there is no particular reason to visit this restaurant. I think you may find better restaurant in Chinatown."
"Always worth the wait
My niece and nephew are regulars here so I just let them order. Scallion pancakes...soup dumplings...garlic
green beans and shredded beef. You can't go wrong"
"I have been to many chinese restaurants through the years and frankly I had given up on chinese food. Too tired of the traditional interpretation of chinese food.
But not so at Joe's.
It's crowded even late at night and you gotta be fast when they are shouting your number through the street.
Inside spirits are high and the waiters are racing around.
Roasted pork, boiled shrimps (with peas), meatballs and some spicy stuff I've forgot the name of.
Everything was terrific, we couldn't stop eating. Let me get back as soon as possible."
"Joe's Shanghai is in a nondescript building in Chinatown, one block from Mott Street. It serves very good Shanghai food and more. Its small pork dumplings (Xiaolongbao) is juicy and excellent. Good regular dumplings, noodle soups, scallion pies, and string beans. It is usually crowded. Cash only, no credit cards."
"Having eaten here a couple times over the years, we find this to be one of the go to restaurants when we visit New York.

Some things to know:

1. I don't think it's ever slow.  Don't let the long line out the door dissuade you from eating at this establishment.  They seat people very quickly, which leads to #2
2. Community dining.  If you are a party of 2 and there are two seats available at a table where others are eating, they will seat you there.  It seems awkward at first, but you quickly get used to it.
3.  The soup dumplings is why everyone goes and is why you should go too.  They come in two flavors: pork and seafood (crab I think).  You get 8 in one order, so for two that is plenty.  They are dangerously hot and you should research how to eat them properly so you don't look like a fool in front of your new dining companions (see #2)
4.  The best way to describe the service is - ""efficient"".  They don't mess around.  There are no pleasantries.  It is basically, ""What do you want?"" and ""Here you go"".  And don't be surprised if they get frustrated that you can't understand a word they say.
5.  CASH ONLY - they do not take cards.  They have an ATM there, but I am sure it charges some ridiculous usage fee.
6.  Not the cleanest restaurant.  Just ignore it.

Any other restaurant would get a rating of 2, but the experience and food double the rating.  Happy Dining."
We were a group of 6 and sat at a shared table. The food was really good and there was a good selection for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Service was the only downside as the staff were quite abrupt and you felt you were being rushed to leave.
"While most of the Chinese food action has moved to Queens, Joe's Shanghai manages to stay relevant and good. The crab pork soup dumplings are amaze. The turnip cake is the stuff of dreams. The pork with scallions is great. Go."
"While in The Village we decided to walk to Chinatown. had a great lunch at Joe's Shanghai. My family enjoyed the soup dumplings and liked the pork best. I had Kung Pow Chicken. Everything was terrific, food was tasteful and served piping hot.
Waited for 30 minutes but it went quickly."
We walked to Chinatown from the 9/11 Memorial.  Enjoyed the walk.  Got to Joe's around 2:00 PM.  Still had a wait.  It was well worth it!  Everything was fabulous.  The best dish we had was the Prawns in Citrus Flower.  Must give this a try.
Wow.  They were so good.  We also had crispy duck and sauteed green beans.  Very good too.  Get an order of dumplings for every two people.  If sitting at communal tables is not your thing this is not your place.
"You must eat at Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown!  What an amazing experience. The family style servings were perfect for my son and I who have the same food preferences. General Tso's chicken was amazingly light and crunchy and perfectly spicy!  The pork soup dumplings and vegetable fried rice also were scrumptious and fully satisfying. Take cash- and if you aren't too handy with chopsticks, they DO have forks (which admittedly I needed).  This is a Chinatown must eatery."
"Had to wait for half hour for 2 seats and we shared a table with 2 other couples. Very busy and bustling place. Kinda stuffy after a while from the aircond.  We wanted some xiao loong pau and that's the first thing the waiter asked as soon as we sat down. They take your order for the dumplings first and the rest later.

Good yummy dumplings that are big. Portions of other dishes we ordered were big too. Quality very good, service acceptable for a no frills restaurant."
"This is a great hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in the heart of NYC's China Town. I try to eat here every trip I make to the city. I live in NC and don't get up there very often. 
Family style seating at large tables. 
The soup dumplings are phenomenal and for me are worth the wait to get. 
I've never had a bad meal or service here and this last visit didn't disappoint. 
I highly recommend Joe's Shanghai."
"We were directly here by some local friends and it did not disappoint. The best pork and crab dumplings/buns I have ever had before, no doubt. We also tried the Szechuan Sliced Beef, Seafood rice, Orange Chicken, and Prawns with Citrus sauce. All were amazing. The sliced beef was very spicy but very good. Incredibly memorable trip to Chinatown. I can't not wait to go back."
"Our first visit to this very busy (be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation) midtown restaurant.  It has a very authentic Chinese menu. The soup dumplings were fantastic and the sea bass with bean sauce amazing. 
The Peking-style chicken was simply fried and ordinary. The salt and pepper pork similarly ordinary. 
Service is very rushed as they plead to try and turn over the tables as fast as humanly possible."
We tried this restaurant based on TA rating. The dumplings are incredibly good and were literally a dumpling filled with soup. We tried the pork and the prawn and both excellent. Beware it is better to eat the whole dumpling in one go otherwise you run the risk of loosing the soup or possibly losing it over your clothes. We also had the special prawn dish of the day and it was excellent.  Worth it just for the soup dumplings.
"Came with some co-workers and we had a variety of stuff.  Definitely get the XLB (soup dumplings)  if for nothing else to say you had them.  Also had the shanghai rice cakes and must have the scallion pancakes.  The place is pretty busy all day, particularly on the weekend.  There was a long line around 3pm, but the line moves quick.  About 30 minute wait.  Expect to sit at communal tables with others.  They really pack you in there.  The turnip app was good and flavorful as well.   The fried dumplings were not great so won't order again."
Delicious and fairly priced with large portions. Plan to sit with another group of people but enjoy this authentic food and good service.  A must do. We will be back !
"Small restaurant located in Chinatown. Be prepared to share a table with other guests if you don't have a large party. The food was quite good, but the star of the show was the soup dumplings! Don't leave without placing an order...or two!"
"I have been going to Joe Shanghai for roughly 20 years, way back to their original Flushing location. They never disappoint. Haven't been to this location in a very long time as
I don't live close anymore. The soup buns were perfect and just as good as I remembered them!"
"If you've never had steamed Shanghai Buns, you can't go wrong with Joe's. They're fresh, hot, flavorful and as some refer to them, ""juicy"". They come out quite quick...once you have a chance to order them. There's usually a long line and quite a wait and in the past well worth it.  Today we were a party of five and were seated very quickly. There just seemed to be a tremendous amount of scurrying about by the seemingly abundance of help. Some in yellow shirts and some in black and yet others in red. We just couldn't figure out who was our waiter and after asking four different people for ice water, (it was hot and humid, close to 90 degrees in NYC) we finally got some after 15 minutes of waiting. There just didn't seem to be much teamwork between the workers and no one was smiling.  
This was our fifth visit to Joe's and was very surprised at what a chaotic lunch experience it was. Hopefully just an off day for Joe's Shanghai!"
The food is ok. It is quite authentic but certainly not impressive. I'm not sure if I'll bother queueing for table again. I haven't tried other Chinese restaurants in NYC so I am not sure if it is way better than the others. You are very likely to share a table with strangers as other reviewers have mentioned. As they are used to this system so there is no problem or risk for mixing up your orders. As soon as you sit down the waiter will come to ask if you want some soup dumplings to start with - say yes as they are good.
"Joe's Shanghai is in China town in NYC. A simple place but lots of fun and the food is great. Expect to wait in line and that just adds to the anticipation. While you are waiting walk around and check out the area and the competition. When you do get in you probably will be put at a big round table with others. If you are lucky they will already be eating so you can find out about their dishes. Interesting food, service is all over you ( they want you in / out) and there is a great buzz there. It is reasonably priced and all in all a fun experience."
"I was surprised to be sat at a large table with two other parties, but it wasn't a bad experience at all. They know what they are doing.

Get the dumplings and scallion cakes. The broccoli beef was okay, but the fried rice and lo mein was delicious!"
"The wait on a Sunday night for dinner was about 45 minutes and as far as the food was concerned it was worth it. My family and I had a few entrees and some dumplings and the food was great.

To reiterate what a few other people have stated the place feels like a tourist trap and is way too expensive (even for NYC). Cash only is also a negative along with waiters who hover over you and watch you eat."
"In a place that tou would not even think about entering the door in a street that you would avoid to go theough and eith a service that you would never accept, there you have the surprise. Great food, crowded (you can be sharing table) but the true essence of the history of NY and Chinatown and at a great price. Fully recommended to feel the experience"
Wonderful meal in a buzzing restaurant.  Would highly recommend the dumplings. May have to wait for a table but worth doing so.
"Tourist restaurant, unfriendly personel amd average food. 15% tip already included in bill! I would not go twice!"
"Husband want to go to this restaurant. I went along for the ride/experience. You sit at tables with other groups, which was a little awkward for my taste. Food was good, but nothing better than I could find at home."
"We picked this place from looking at reviews on the internet. The great reviews were correct. When we arrived there were people waiting outside to get in, a sure sign that it is a good place to eat. 

The food was authentic and nicely priced. An entrée came in under 20.00."
"The dim sum was really a piece of work and the other dishes were delicious, is cheap but there's always a long line, so be patient and wait, it's worth it."
"You'd be the only one at this crowded typical Chinatown eatery wearing one but after slurping down a few of their famous soup dumplings you'll appreciate my advice.  The dumplings are filled with a pork and crab morsel and an excellent tasty broth. Eating them itself is both challenging and fun. My advice is to pick one up with a soup ladle,bite off the top and slurp out the soup, and then devour the rest of the dumpling.
The rest of the menu contains a great variety of shanghai style dishes. The noodle dishes particularly the shanghai noodles are very tasty. There is also a good selection of vegetarian meals. The not so vegetarian eggplant dish - it contains a bit of pork - is really excellent. They also have some interesting specials  for the more adventurous.  
The wait staff varied tremendously from exceptionally friendly to  the rather surly. The restaurant is a typical no-frills Chinatown dive and when crowded you will generally find yourself seated at a table with people you've never met but if you go with the right attitude can have fun with.
This is a must visit when you are in China town on vacation and a place to frequent if you live here."
I was introduced to Xioa Long Boa 2 years ago in Shanghai and really liked them. And now 2 years later in the middle of China Town in NYC I had the pleasure of savouring these wonderful Shanhai specialities. Only difference was that in NXC we also had the option of crab meat filling as well - really delicious. I cannot say if the Shanghai originals or the NYC variation was better but they were soooo good. Will have to visit Joe's in Pell Str. soon again.
"Make a plan to visit. This is a ""must eat at"" restaurant. Pork dumplings and lo mien were the best I ever had."
Soup dumplings were yummy and a fun experience. Our teenage daughters loved them and had fun eating them. Also had the pork lo mien. It was solid too. Go if you get the chance and then explore the area.
"While I'm a big fan of Joe's for dinner,  the cash only joint in the heart of China Town is not great for dim sum. 
First of all the dumpling selection is scattered through the menu,  as the restaurant does not really look at it as different than any other Chinese appetizers meal. The soup dumpling had been sitting for a while and half of them stuck to the bamboo steamer,  breaking when picked up. Lastly,  the selection was quite poor, with mostly pork and very little seafood. 
Again, great to eat a full meal,  not for dim sum."
"We come here every time we visit NYC. There is always a short wait and the place is hopping. The dumplings are amazing and addicting. The other food is good as well but the dumplings are the best around. Don't let the cover fool you, there is good food to be had here."
"The best pork steamed dumplings I've ever tried!  The rest of the entrees are really good too.  I have not been to China, but I bet this gets really close to be authentic Chinese food.

This is the third time I eat here.  This time, we were seated right away, but the other two we've experienced ~30min wait.  Most of the tables at this restaurant seat 10 people, so come prepared to share the table with other parties.  The place seems a bit run-down, but I bet it is because of the heavy traffic... very popular place.

A kettle of green tea is served complimentary to every party and it is delicious."
"Amazing food! huge portions!

The pork dumplings are amazing and a must try!

Service was quick and the company at the tables was fun. We were sat next to several couples on one of the large 6 person tables and it was no problem. 

In fact we ended up sitting next to a celebrity later in the evening who mingled in with all of the other customers.

All in all fantastic food and well worth making the effort to wait in line for a table. The line moves really quickly and is well organised so don't be put off!"
"Came here for xiaolongbao - overall very large with lots of soup, filling. If you are a dumpling connoisseur, you will not be amazed by these dumplings compared to other dumpling hot spots around the world. Nonetheless, on a cold winter afternoon, worth stopping by if you happen to be visiting Chinatown. Service is quick, be prepared to sit with other customers."
Be prepared to queue. This was our second visit and we went between lunch and dinner time and it was still full. Queue moves quickly though and we waited around 10 minutes. Service is fast but efficient. Don't expect to have a slow and lingering romantic type dinner here. The food is great though and good value compared to NY restaurants in general. Worth the hype.
"Really tasty and authentic Chinese food here with a lovely restaurant. 
Special dumplings were exceptional. Just 2 of us and had to sit on a big table with other people. I guess that's a cultural thing so we were open minded, being from England we are used to having a table to ourselves but it was quite nice to experience."
"You have to come here to eat the dumplings! Excellent lunch we had, some shrimps , some duck  , some dumplings and the company of other chinese costumers at the table. It was nice, they taught us how to eat the dumplings :) ! A Must Experience when coming to NY !"
Chaotic and genuine chinese restaurant. Prices are cheap. Food is good. For sure you will share a table with other people but you will really enjoy the chaos
"Lively, chaotic,  exciting,  tasty dinner.

Busy,  restaurant with plenty of staff to make it run smoothly. No hanging around here! 
Not the most slick looking in presentation but it all seemed pretty genuine.  

The food did did come quickly and certainly was tasty for the parents. 

Not sure it was the best choice with kids who were not feeling extra adventurous. 

We went for Dumplings to start with which were tasty and seemed to be the specialty.    The mains were good and we didn't have room for pudding!
Price was OK but a 15% service charge was added.

Overall was a good experience."
"For the record, it was about a 30 minute wait and I noticed surrounding restaurants had no wait.  I now know why.  Amazing soup dumplings, seriously amazing.  Chicken fish was ridiculously good.  Probably the best Chinese I have had since Singapore many years back..."
"Tried our fair share of foods: steamed dumplings, steamed pork buns, scallion pancake, spicy shredded beef, and eggplant stir fry with pork....all did not disappoint. We waited for about 30 minutes, but worth it. I can see why it's popular. If you want a delish place to dine while in Chinatown - Joe's Shanghai is THE place."
"When visiting New York (from California) my kids (now discerning teenagers!) always want to run down to Chinatown and eat at Joe's Shanghai to have soup dumplings and Szechuan sliced beef.  It's fun to be seated wherever they put us, often at a big round table where others will be seated whom we don't know, but we get to know them quickly as we all exchange our ideas on favorite dishes at Joe's!  Take family, take friends, take kids.... there's something for everyone.  Don't expect fancy, but do expect delicious.  You'll have to hunt a bit to find it on Pell Street, and it's worth the hunt.  The New York Times, Zagat, Gourmet Magazine, and Travel and Leisure have all discovered Joe's Shanghai over the years and have rated it the best Chinese in the tri-state area.  I understand why!  I'll be back again on my next trip from California."
"We had an 'early' dinner in this place. If you arrived in the usual dinner time (after 6pm), be prepared to wait - there is a long row of chairs outside the restaurant for people in waiting. The food was wonderful - in particular, the small steamed dumplings (bao-zi), which were juicy inside and very tasty. These bao-zi are the best you can get anywhere. We also ordered a plate of veggie, which turned out costing us the equivalent of two cases of bao-zi (8 pieces in each case)."
"The dumplings filled with soup are like the ones you get in China. However, not just the dumplings are great. We had a peking duck that was out of this world! Great place...we chose to dine in while they have a take out just a few doors down."
This was a bit of a strange experience for us.  We knew from the reviews that we wanted to try the soup dumplings so we had to come give this place a try. We got here shortly after 11 when they open and were seated right away. We were seated at a table against the wall and were shortly joined by 3 other people which was a little awkward. Thankfully these people spoke Chinese and were able to translate a few things for us. We ordered the pork soup dumplings and pork fried rice. It took a very long time for our food to arrive. I noticed people who got there after we did got their food a while before us. Our fried rice eventually came out and it was pretty good. The soup dumplings arrived about 5-10 minutes later. These were challenging to eat (I had to glance at other tables to see how they were eating them) but were quite tasty. This place only takes cash (the people dining at our table also researched the restaurant but didn't know about the cash only rule) so make sure you have cash before you go.  Prices were great for New York!
"Soup dumplings are the best, many other great dishes here. Very busy on weekends.
No reservations, usually a line outside."
"I love authentic chinese food and we are excited to tried the soup dumplings. They are good.
Maybe the ambience did not help, unfriendly waiter, the rush, the community table, besides a lot noise.
Be prepare they only accept cash."
"Went here twice during my stay with the wife. Came back just for the crab Dumplings, incredibly delicious. Note: be sure you know how to properly eat them or you're gonna have a bad time.

Service gets mixed reviews here but I think it is just a cultural thing. It's very straightforward but I had no problem with it.

The dishes are also nice, but nothing spectacular."
"Well, as the picture shows above, their soup dumplings are very good, but we didn't know there would be 8 per serving.  The three of us ordered one serving apiece and it was waaay too much food.  There are two types of dumplings:  pork and shrimp.  Order one of each for a group of 4.  We also ordered a main dish apiece and sampled everyone's food.  We were seated at a communal table and had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated."
"Visited at about 9pm Saturday night and was told there would be a 30minutw wait (expected more) but was seated in only 20 minutes. Typical Chinese restaurant with little ambiance, noisy and crowed but totally worth it for the food. I have eaten A LOT of dumplings in my time and these have to be ranked quite high on the list. The soup dumplings were so good, large with lots of broth inside and good flavour. We also had the fried pork dumplings which were so crispy and also had a really good flavour. We also had pork fried rice and the special chicken in ginger sauce. Both were very delicious and the chicken was so crispy. The service is efficient and straight to the point but they are more than happy to pack any leftovers for you. Well worth a visit and very reasonably priced."
Late lunch not common in the area which explains the decent crowd here.  Tried the dumplings but was not overly impressed.  However found other gems on the menu including Szechuan  green beans and prawns with broccoli.  The sauce covering the shrimp was outstanding.  Don't forget to bring cash or specifically request white rice as a side else tough luck.
"This place had lines at 2:30 in the afternoon.  It is cash only and you sit in communal tables. There is no ambiance whatsoever, it's not for a romantic date but if you want excellent pork soup dumpling then this is the place.  We also ordered the shrimp noodle soup that had a really good flavor but the scallion pancake was a let down. I forgot to mention that this place have very inexpensive food for NY standards.  The service is fast but don't expect friendly.  There is only one bathroom each for men and women and it is not very nice but you don't come here for nice bathrooms or ambience. You can definitely believe the hype."
"Joe's Shanghai like the review said when you arrive at the restaurant there is a long line outside. Go inside and take a number. The girl said it would take a half an hour. It's worth the wait. You the sit at large round tables of about 12 people. Which can be both enjoyable or not. I enjoyed it. I split a soup with my daughter. Excellent. We drank tee. Then we shared a portion of soup dumplings. They were sensational, noodles filled with ground pork and soup. They should be gingerly taken out of the basket, placed on spoon and then bite into heaven. The remaining soup runs into the spoon. Then we shared a portion of green beans and beef. Fresh and not fried or greasy. We finished with orange slices. Sweet and juicy. The bill was $36."
"Our son who lives in New York has been wanting to visit here. He's stopped by before and found lines waiting to get in. So we arrived early on a Saturday night, about 5:00 p.m. We got in, but it was still quite crowded. We were on a large round table that seated about 10. The three of us were seated with two other parties at the same table, one a party of three and the other a party of two. When we left we walked through about 20 people waiting outside to get in. So go at odd hours if you don't want to wait. 

Take cash. We did not realize until we were seated that they don't take credit cards. We had to pool cash to come up with enough. 

Order dumplings. They are apparently known for their dumplings. In particular their soup dumplings were delicious and relatively inexpensive. We ordered three dumpling and noodle dishes and all were great. We also ordered green beans, salt and pepper shrimp and salt and pepper pork. They were good, but I've had better in California."
"The service is horrible, but the soup dumplings are amazing! I've had them before and they didn't compare to this place. They were big, juicy, and fresh! We also ordered the fried pork dumplings and I was not impressed at all. I would only recommend coming  for the soup dumplings, which is called ""steamed pork buns"" on their menu. And don't forget the cash, as they do not accept credit card."
"I found this place on Yelp and was super excited to try it when visiting NY.  I love love LOVE soup dumplings so anytime I hear of a place that serves good ones, I have to try it.  Came on a Friday at 6pm and missed the rush.  Didn't have to wait for a table.  We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, green onion pancake, and Singapore noodles.  The green onion pancake came out first, and it was delicious.  A little on the greasy side, but I still liked it.  The soup dumplings came out next and they were piping hot.  Of course my boyfriend burned his tongue because he couldn't wait.  I waited a couple minutes to let it cool down before biting into it.  OH MAN.   SO GOOD.  SO MUCH SOUP.  I've had a lot of soup dumplings in my life, and this one is definitely. on top of the list as far as best tasting.  Seriously, it was so good.  In my opinion, it's better than Din Tai Fung, and you get more for your money.  It was like $8 or $9 for 8 big pieces.  I can't wait to come here to eat these again next time I'm in NY.  oh, the Singapore rice noodles were not good.  Instead of using BBQ pork, they use ham. And not good ham.  Ham that tasted spoiled.  We barely touched the plate.  Just come for the soup dumplings.  That's where it's at."
"Once you arrive, make sure you go inside and tell the hostess that you would like to add your name to the list. She will give you a ticket with a number on it that you have to listen for when you are standing outside. This place is traditional in that you will sit at a large table with other guests outside your party (which I find quite fun). The dumplings are definitely a must (I had the pork ones, which are listed as pork buns on the menu). I find myself wanting some right now actually..."
"There's a queue outside...need I say more? Authentic Chinese food, served at communal tables, which was great as I was travelling on my own :) inexpensive and easy, cool place for a quick dinner - though I felt a bit rushed. 
Not so good if you want to have a chilled time hanging out with friends chatting"
"This restaurant, like so many in Chinatown, is cash only. We took my sister, brother-in-law, and their two sons ages 11 &14 here for dinner. Definitely get the signature dumplings. WE were at a table for 8 even though there were only 6 of us, so we were sitting with two men we didn't know. But that turned out to be really helpful, because they taught us how to eat the dumplings. Bite them and let some of the broth spill into your mouth and the rest into the soup spoon. Then you can eat the rest as you will. We went family style and got several dishes to share. Do not miss the fish in sake. It looks pale and slimy but it doesn't taste that way, and it has a stupendous broth. We did have to wait about 15 minutes to get in at 6:30, but we walked around outside, so it went quickly.  The boys liked everything too. Don't be afraid to take younger people here. It's a great experience."
"The line moves rather quickly and just know you'll be seated next to strangers but it's a cool experience. We had the drunken chicken, Xiao long baos and the mu shu pork. The dumplings are excellent, just like what you'd expect from all the reviews."
"Beyond a delicious dumpling start, we went for more classic Chinese cooking: sichuan beef (a ""Chef specialty"") and string beans with pork.  The beef was beautifully spiced and tender, and the beans were very fresh and perfectly cooked.   Nothing fancy about this place; very classic Chinatown feel.  But the food is really good."
The soup dumpling was yummy. I have to say the crab meat dumpling is one of the best I ever tried. They dont look good but that means they are home made. The down side was the waiters were rude.
"Decided to visit Chinatown for dinner on our last trip to New York. My daughter had read in the Lonely Planet guide book that Joe's Shanghai was a good place to go for a no frills authentic Chinese meal so we decided to give it a go. Arrived and restaurant was buzzing and very busy, we were lucky and had only to wait 15 minutes outside for seats at a shared table. The hot tea waiting at the table was very welcome. Our waiter was hard to understand but actually got our order nearly right, one extra meal appeared, still not sure why!!! but he took it back. The food was excellent and our party all enjoyed it.  If you are looking for a different experience and good food Joe's Shanghai is the place to go."
"This restaurant is small and old. No frills. Of course, it has the bizarre cliché Asian restaurant oversized fish tank when you walk in and you may be waiting by it for some time if you get there before 2:30 pm. The servers are not the easiest to understand but the first thing they ask is if you want dumplings. Although there is dumplings on the menu, this means the buns. You can have pork or crab & pork filled, which I highly recommend. You will read articles posted along the walls that say Joe's has lost its luster since becoming so popular. Not true. These dumplings/buns/whatever you want to call them are awesome. They are filled with soup, steamed to perfection and, after ordering half the menu, we all agreed we would have just ordered more dumplings. 

Here are a couple of extras to note...

We tried the spicy cabbage appetizer. Good but not spicy. Nothing special. They told me the best thing on the menu was prawns in chili sauce. It was good and did not have that dirty shrimp taste a lot of places do. We had beef soft pan fried noodles (basically, lo mein) which was good. Noodles had good texture, included mushrooms and bean sprouts but was missing that one spice which makes something pop.

Also, it is posted everywhere that ""for your convenience the management has included a 15% service charge"" on your ticket. So much for the no tipping precedence New York supposedly set!

Finally, THIS RESTAURANT IS CASH ONLY and there is no ATM in the place. Bring money."
"Little restaurant with original Cantonese cooking. Nothing to compare with the usual Chinese restaurants we have in Buenos Aires. We ordered 5 kind of dumplings, it was the first time I ate them and I love them! The noodle soup was very good too."
"We went to Joe's Shangai on the fire cracker day of Chinese New Year, and therefore had to wait half an hour to be seated. The service was, let's say typically for Chinese restaurants, not overly friendly but fast. We ordered a tray of crab dumplings and fried mochi with beef and green pepper. A pot of tea was served for free, very welcome on this extremely cold day. The food was very, very good. I'll never forget these crab dumplings. Very reasonable prices, too. We will definitely come back!"
"Waited 45 minutes for a table on Saturday evening - even had time for an $8 haircut next door.
Excellent food but served topsy turvy - several main courses before the appetizers. 
Worth a visit- just bring cash, some patience, and a hearty appetite."
"Place is good no doubt about it ... Service is ""Chinese Style"" meaning don't be afraid to raise your hand. Don't expect the wait staff to go out of its way to be at your 'beck and call' throughout your dining experience. 

Place is CASH ONLY so put your name down grab your number then go around the corner to the ATMs ... Remember how long you waited to be seated and be aware there maybe a similar wait while your dining (so don't linger)."
"Have to go in and get a number to wait for a table and then wait outside.  The wait for lunch on a Sunday was about 35 minutes.  As soon as we sat down, we were asked if we were going to order the dumplings.  Since this is their number one dish, they want to order it fast so you can start eating right away and get out of there.  They were delicous and worth the venturing into  China Town.  The servings are larger at this location and also cheaper than at their other place.  Besides the two orders of dumplings we ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and broccoli and one other dish for four of us.  The service is very fast and they brought us the check right away without asking if we wanted dessert or coffee. We also had to pay in cash as they did not accept credit cards.  Despite all that, the authencity of the food in the middle of China Town and those delicious dumplings made for a great meal."
"The best dumplings (listed as pork buns) in New York so far! The other food is average at best but the dumplings were amazing. Don't be put off by the staff, they are a bit unfriendly and the turnover at the restaurant is very high but the dumplings are worth it!"
"A tip from someone waiting in line for half price tickets lead us to Joe's for the soup dumplings. A fan of Din Tai Fung on the West coast, we were here to consume and compare. It's kind of chaos, there is a crowd at the door and you need to find the hostess and take a number. She gives you a little raffle ticket with a number, takes your name and you then just crowd and hope. We were pretty sure she forgot about us, when she came back and checked everyones number. But, no worries, we were seated after a total of about 15-20 minutes. There were two of us and we were placed at a table with another group of 5 and that seems to be the norm. This wasn't a problem and added for a bit of friendly interaction for Joe's noobs. Almost before they bring water or say hello, they ask straight out how many orders of Soup dumplings you will want. They realize that the soup dumplings are why most of the people are there, and they don't mess around. I think we had the first order on the table in less than 5 minutes from sitting down. Those were fantastic! In my opinion they were even tastier than Din Tie Fung's, but really difficult to eat. They are much larger - so you (or at least we) couldnt' just pop a whole one in your mouth. But the flavor, amazing. We also ordered potstickers, that were really good, some kind of soft garlic noodles (a lot of their noodle dishes have fried crispy noodles) and a wonderfully greasy and oniony onion cake. It was soooo much food, we were disgustingly full - so full that we didn't really eat dinner that evening, and the whole bill was $30 - what a deal! I'm a big fan and will be dreaming about this place for years to come!"
"The Soup Dumplings, listed on the menu as Pork Steamed Buns, are in my opinion, not as good as they were in the past. The broth is not as flavorful as I remember it to be about 6 months ago. I think that you can get tastier Soup Dumplings at the Shanghai Pavillion on the upper east side of Manhattan. I enjoyed the Sliced Pork with Scallions very much. It was very flavorful."
"Visited NYC for a wedding. My daughter is always the avid tour guide, reading reviews and planning the trips. She did well. First it was a treat just walking to, and finding Joes. Hint: eat a little early. Look at the photos of the lines out front. Food was great, as everyone says, service was too, accommodating every request in a very bustling environment. That was the charm. Crowded, energetic, efficient, colorful, and pretty quick for how crowded it was. But I must say, one of the neatest things was apparently a common NYC thing, where you shared tables with others. Doesn't happen where I'm from. So you may sit next to a stranger(s), but then the weirdest part, you don't talk to them. But still intriguing. Trust the reviews, believe my daughter - Eat at Joes.  Oh yeah, the dumplings were so cute, and so good."
"The soup dumplings and pancake were good, pan fried noodles were awesome, and general tsao chicken was amazing! Great quality and good portions. Only complaint is the seating system, really unfair."
"The Food is ok, the Dumplings are the only real thing you should get here. Don't be surprised if the servers are a little harsh and try and rush you out of there (They flip a ton of tables a night) Also you have to sit next to someone else which is always an adventure in New York. Overall its good, but just for lunch."
"This was my second time visiting this restaurant.  The last time was in 2005 where the food was very good.  This time we ordered beef fried rice and beef lomein and it was a bit greasy and not very hot.  Not only that,the service was not at all good.  We asked for water five different time until he realized that we indeed wanted water.  When the food finally did show up, it was kind of thrown on the table like it was a bother.  Not only that, they DO NOT accept credit cards."
"Great spot in Chinatown to grab some grub!  Prepare for a lengthy wait to get in .... we went across the street and had a foot massage while we waited :)
We were seated at a large round table with other people, which made it even more interesting ... a round table full of their famous dumplings!  Enjoy.
Cash only."
"We've been going to Joe's Shanhai for more than 20 years.  We try other restaurants but always go back because they're the best.  There's always been lines, but now the place is really popular.  However, the wait time goes fast, because most tables are shared and there's no wasted space. In the beginning we would try to wait for private tables, but over the years, the shared dining experience has come to be fun.  We've met many great people.  Its not a fancy place, but the food is consistent and good.  Always try the pork steamed buns.  You can't get better anywhere else"
"Came to Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown on a friend's recommendation and it did not disappoint! Had been warned about long wait but as we came in the early afternoon just after lunch rush hour we got seated immediately. The place is on a small side street slightly off the main buzz - but hard to miss thanks to its bright signs. The place is set up with mainly large tables, and if you're a small party - like 2 - you will most likely share a table. This is not a place for a romantic dinner - but for a laid back very yummy meal with friends/family! Service is efficient - with a very busy place as expected. Would definitively recommend if you want a good taste of Chinatown"
"My friend and I visited Joe's Shanghai while in the city for the day, suffering from an insatiable craving for xiaolongbao. This place definitely delivered. We ordered the pork xiaolongbao and scallion pancakes. Both were excellent. The xiaolongbao were as good as any I've had in Shanghai.

Definitely will come back next time I'm in NYC.

Note: When we were there, the place was fairly busy so there was a wait. Also, they seat you at communal tables, which didn't bother us, but might bother some. Instead, we got to be entertained by one of the other guys at the table eating the cabbage (used as a leak guard) out of the xiaolongbao basket. Interesting."
"Don't expect to be treated like a King or Queen. Service is not warm and fuzzy, but the Dumplings are worth waiting for the ever random, non sequential wait list. If you don't want to wait in the alley for an hour, get your feet rubbed across the street. This is a must go for every visit. 

PS - cash only"
Soup dumplings to die for! Service? Ehh. Food? Wow. They give you a number then call out names in the street where a happy albeit hungry mob waits.
Order soup dumplings for 9$ they are not listed in the menue which sucks because everything in the menue costs double. But we got help from an other guest that got ripped of and we got our soup dumpling and they tasted good. And the service is included in the bill so you dont have to tip.
"The rating would lead you to believe this restaurant will be fabulous. Despite the wait which we expected based on the ratings, the service was rushed, the staff was not terribly friendly and the food was mediocre. Because Our expectations were high, we order the chefs special crispy beef. It was disappointing. Lo mein was better elsewhere. The prices are very high."
"We usually pass Joe's Shanghai if there's a line and go straight to Joe's Ginger, wrongly assuming that they were interchangeable.  We recently went at an odd time and there was no line at Joe's Shanghai so we decided to give it another try.  Everything was very similar but just a little bit better at Joe's Shanghai.  The soup dumplings all sprung leaks when carefully picked up but they were delicious.  The special fried chicken with ginger was an entire chicken perfectly cooked but could have used a bit more ginger.  If there's a long line I don't think it's worth waiting but if you have the time, it is simply the best.  Beware- automatic tip and cash only."
"Don't mind the lines, it's worth the wait.  The food is always fresh, must try the soup dumplings.  Waiters work quickly to get you seated and served! It's a great experience."
"The soup dumplings were good, but somehow this time was not as great as my previous visits in the past. I guess maybe the dumplings were not as the right temperature as it was supposed to be- the wraps were a bit dry and tough. We went around 3PM so there was no line! 
Anyway, the restaurant has changed the way of billing to customers by including 15% service charges. Therefore, please make sure that you don't double the tips!!!!!"
"Their food is very good, especially their famous soup dumplings. We had their Kung Pau chicken that was delicious, and their seefood noodles. 
The problem was that it took us an hour to get a table for 4 ppl. Once we got the table, the service wasn't very good and the atmosphere was very stressful. It felt like they want us to eat quickly and leave as fast as possible to make room for other people. 

Note: Cash only."
"The wait line was out the door, but surprisingly it moved fast.  Deuces are seated together at big tables which keeps things moving. 
We waited in line, sat down,  ordered and ate all within an hour. 
Two menu items that we delicious were the perennial favorite soup dumplings (pork) and the shredded crispy beef was out of this world. 
Waiters are there to service,  no small talk,  and have ur order ready or be prepared for serious eye rolling or they just plain walk away. 
Great Chinatown experience and food. 
Cash only... 6 of us $120."
"We have been on the super search for the best Shanghai Soup dumplings in the world. Even in Hong Kong and Guangjou, China, I must say that Joe's has dumplings so succulent with soup that we need bigger spoons to catch the soup!  

The other dishes are very authentic and really good, even though they are upstaged by the soup dumplings.  

The place has good sized tables that you must share which always happens unless your party exactly fills 8 or 4 for their standard tables. 

The wait staff is typical Chinatown, NY quick, curt, and don't expect more.  So what! It's part of the atmosphere.  Haha! China is no different.  Look, you can go uptown to Shun Lee and get great service, and alot less at 5 times the price.  

Great place!"
"Woody Allen once said that while scientists try to map the Universe, he
couldn't find his way around Chinatown.  But here's an address that's easy to
locate: 9 Pell St. between Bowery and Mott, New York City.  (From Broadway, head east on Canal, hang a right on Mott, then left on Pell St.)  Your reward is the perfect
dumpling lunch.  Joe's Shanghai features exceptional soup dumplings served
at large round tables (expect to share with strangers); it starts filling up for
lunch at 11am, a sign of its popularity with locals and tourists alike.  Eating the
dumplings with chopsticks and a ceramic soup spoon is an acquired skill: the
trick is to puncture the underside so the soup drains into the spoon.  At least
one customer describes the dumplings as ""better than sex.""  Be that as it may,
they are certainly worth the journey to downtown Manhattan."
"I have now been to Joe's 3 times, I have gone every time I have visited the city since I was introduced to it in 2004. The dumplings are delicious, broccoli beef is the best I have had anywhere, their green beans YUM, and I tried something I think that they called Bird's Nest. The portions are huge, so pick a few and share so you can try more than one thing. They are known for their pork soup dumplings, so PLEASE do yourself a favor and try them!!!!"
"Joe’s Shanghai is an excellent choice in an area of town packed with good Chinese restaurants.  It is always packed, there is always a line and you will be sharing a big table with strangers – and that makes it all the more interesting.  The line moves quickly and you won’t have to wait more that 10 to 20 minutes. They have a relatively standard menu, but you must have the pork dumplings.  I would also recommend the garlic eggplant.  Enjoy, and order enough to make sure you have left-overs to take home for tomorrow."
Love this place in China town! The food is amazing as I live in Maryland and we have nothing close to this. We always get the following: pork and pork & crab soup dumplings. Make sure to punch hole in dumpling and drink soup on the spoon so you do not burn your chin! We also order the Lion's heads along with the Shanghai fried rice. This time because we had a extra person we also got the General Tso's Chicken which was very good. This place is a great bang for your buck. The service is always excellent.
"I love soup dumplings, and a friend told me about this place.  They are not only good, they are addictive.  I found my mind wandering back to Joe's during my meetings, in anticipation of going back for more of the delicious soup dumplings.

Bring cash, as they do not accept credit cards.  The prices are very, very reasonable, and the portions are large.  It is a great, authentic place to eat lunch or dinner."
"Okay so I heard great things about this place and yelp raves about this place so I went out of my way to check this place out. Got there and there was about a 30min wait, no problem - there's definitely a lot of things to do around there. The seating is with a group of people in a round table, it was pretty cool I must say.
Food is not that good to be honest. I was with my wife and dad and none of us enjoyed our food. Food is plain and nothing special at all. To top it off!!! The tip is already included ! A nice 20% regardless of what you order or how much you order. It wasn't worth the $$$. Wouldn't go back"
"We asked our cab driver for a recommendation for food in Chinatown, and he said everyone goes here - I can see why. The restaurant is basic, strangers sit together ok big tables, when it's busy (as it often is) you wait outside on the slightly dodgy looking street. But the food is fantastic and the infamous soup dumplings are AMAZING. The portions were huge we had to take away with us what we couldn't eat! Absolute must do on the food list for New York, and also amusing seeing the wall of fame of celebrities who have visited too"
"I had a business lunch here in January 2016.  It is on a side street off of Mott Street so it may be hard to find.  I was told that it is usually jam-packed but today we were lucky and got a table.  Perhaps it was the cold weather.  The restaurant has large tables and they seat strangers at your table which can be a very good experience.  We ordered xiaolongbao or soup dumplings which were excellent.  I can vouch for this because I have been to Shanghai many times.  Then subgum noodle soup which had noodles, chicken, pork and some shrimp in broth.  It was a huge portion so we were not able to finish it all.  Then we had home style bean curd which was a little spicy and delicious.  The meal came to about $42 for two people and the service was very good.  I would recommend this place strongly for anybody visiting Chinatown."
"Took my grandkids and family to joe's for pre theatre lunch. Took the 6 train to canal street and walked over.  

The dumplings were as always a real treat.  Fun to eat and delicious. 

We ate at a communal table.  We actually shared some leftovers with others we had so much good.  

Ordered 4 mains and the string beans. White rice on side.  Total before tax and tip was $95.  Very reasonable for all the food we ordered. 

Will return!!"
"This is a popular spot that is famous for their soup dumplings and there's often a wait to be seated, but it's well worth it. Authentic chinese food served in the same manner it would be from Beijing to Sanya. 
A Chinese friend introduced me to the place and I've been back with him dozens of times over the years and taken many friends for the experience. We always order the pork soup dumplings (they also have seafood dumplings) with a soup and other dishes. My 2nd favorite is the Shrimp Fried Rice Cakes. 
They only accept cash so make sure to have some on you, but the prices are reasonable, and I've walked away satisfied every single time."
"We were a group of 10 and had to wait for almost an hour, thank God we could wait sitting on an outside bench and as a group we spent the time just fine near by a couple of us got dumplings for the wait, it served as an appetizer! As we had to wait for an hour our expectations were higher than when we arrived! It was totally worth it!!! All of us asked for a different plate regardless of the waiter advise that it will be too much food! My family eats a lot so we didn't follow his lead, and actually we took plenty home since it was delicious!! Great appetizers, loved the dumplings' soup! The beef and shrimp killed it!!! Will definitely go back but i'll try going on a different season than winter which made the wait a little uncomfortable!!! Or a different time! Wish I remembered the dumpligs small restaurant nearby 'cause is really worth it too!!"
Great food. Place was packed (even for s very late lunch) so expect to queue and share tables. Buns are great and the dishes are very generous - we took home leftover vegetables and noodles. Recommend the vegetables with bean curd and the pork buns especially.
Don't let the tiny first floor fool you.  There is another room upstairs.   Delicious food.   Authentic.   Dim Sum and Peking Duck were excellent.   Would go again.
"One of the famous Chinese restaurants in New York. It was not that tasty, service is average, but overall experience is nice."
"For lunch on a Saturday afternoon our wait was about 30 minutes.  We tried dumplings for the first time and the food was served piping hot.  Prices were very reasonable and the deep fried, full fish (tilapia?) was served with a hot sauce that was adored by all.  (See the picture.)"
"Excellent food, would have been optimal family style with 3 or 4 couples.   Food is very good, four star but the atmosphere is so unique and fun had to give it 5."
Greatest dumplings in New York City. Easy to get to and a very inexpensive lunch or dinner. Also had Beef and noodles that was very tender and good for a cold day.
"We came here based on a suggestion from a local New Yorker who had heard good things about this place. Well, the wait was over an hour on a Saturday night. When they finally called our number, we walked into the restaurant where we waited some more. Instead of being seated right away, we stood there while they called in others that were behind us in the wait line and seated them first. When we asked them when we were going to get seated, the girl first blew us off and then continued to seat others. (They try to maximize filling up each table completely and will seat you communally, with strangers. So depending on the size of your party, if you can fill the remaining space on an existing table, they will seat you first. We had a party of 4 in our group).  The second time we asked the girl just rolled her eyes and walked off. Just as we were to walk away, she seated us at a table with two other groups. We tried the steamed dumplings with the broth inside which I understand is their specialty. We all thought it was ok. Nothing special. The same goes for the rest of the food we tried.  Had we not waited an hour already and got seated when we did we wouldn't have eaten here. Based upon our experience, I do not recommend this place to anyone. The food is average, the service poor, and wait time too long to waste your time with."
So it's not the best customer service BUT keep in mind different culture values etc. On the other hand the food compensates and makes up for the less than great customer service. Try the soup dumplings a MUST! Yum-O
Popped in about 12 and the place was already busy. Constant stream of people coming and going. Very fast service and massive portions that could be shared for lunch. Had the chicken fried rice which had a nice BBQ flavouring to it.  The crispy  shredded beef was good but very sweet. Give it a try.
"We take an annual trip to NYC, and each visit is not complete until we visit Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown!  Hot tea is served as soon as you get seated at your table.  First question out of the waiter's mouth will be ""Do you want dumplings?""  Your answer better be ""YES!""  Their soup dumplings are the most fabulous dumplings I've ever put in my mouth!  You have a choice of pork or crab.  We've ordered both and have been impressed with both.  Another favorite that I definitely HIGHLY recommend is their Scallion Pancakes.  These two dishes are a staple for my family.  On our last visit, we ordered their LoMein and Eggplant in Garlic Sauce... delicious!  We haven't found anything that we have not liked!  Best part...the price!  There aren't many places that you can eat in NYC for under $50 for 4 people!"
Absolute first class authenticate food.  Place really busy and service excellent. Would recommend the soup dumplings for starters. N
I was told that the soup dumplings were worth the trip here and they were OK. Not the best I have had but taste. Wait staff was polite and attentive.
I had wanted to venture into Chinatown again and friends recommended Joe's.  We had to order one of each of the soup buns. Very good!  New experience for us. They are a bit hard to eat and very delicate.  We ordered three other dishes for five people and still had leftovers. The fried rice was great as was the Kung pow chicken. I can't wait to go back!
"Perfect restaurant to visit in Chinatown. When we arrived, the place was packed, a very good sign. The wait for a table was very short - sharing tables with strangers was the order of the day, a good way to meet people for conversation (we met people from Macclesfield). Food was very freshly cooked & fantastic. Portion size was large. Not cheap but good value nonetheless."
"We obviously arrived as they were wanting to close and as such we were treated awfully. 

Stuck on a table with 2 strangers and rushed through the meal. It was comically bad; one waiter in particular was incredibly rude. 

Apart from the dumplings (which were lovely), the food was tasteless.

Can't understand why this place is so popular!"
"Excellent food, great service, well priced.  What more can I ask for.  The dumplings are very good as was the duck and eel.  There is a wide variety on the menu so everyone should be able to find something to their liking.  The place is plain and small so you may end up eating with some strangers at a larger table.  This was not a negative for us, just a surprise.  Be aware that it is cash only.  If you see folks waiting outside do not pass by as the waiting line moves quickly.

If you need a fancy decor or a quiet private setting then this is not a restaurant that I would recommend.  BUT if you are looking for good Chinese food then this is the place.  Overall Joe's Shanghai offers great value."
"Soup dumplings were amazing, crispy fish was also amazing. Shared tables and very plain restaurant where the food is the star. 3 people had 4 beer, 6 dishes for just over $100."
"We had dined here numerical times. Every time when I visited New York China Town, this was my must go place. This time I noticed the food was not taste the same and the quality of the ingredients were not good. The fried rice was liked just mixing the meat with the steam rice. The rice noodle dishes tasted disgusting. What a disappointment. It's a shame to see one of my favorite place going downhill. This is a cash only place, be aware of what you ordered !!!"
So if your in China Town and looking for great homemade family style Chinese food then this is the spot. It's not very big so it gets crowded and they do sit you with other people which makes it better in my opinion it gives a little more of an ambience to the place. Great dumplings and chicken dishes. The beef was OK but you cannot go wrong with the pork dumplings.
"Ok, this was by far one of our favorite experiences in NYC!  The Soup Dumplings are one of the greatest things my whole family has ever tasted...we still talk about going back to NYC just for these.  The place was fun, they sit you at any available table even if its shared.  We had fun sitting and visiting with new people, there were six of us (four teens) and we sat with two other gentlemen who were from NJ and great lunch companions.  All i can say is don't miss out on the soup dumplings...AMAZING!!!"
Was recommended by the Hotel we stayed in and we weren't disappointed....The food was excellent....Staff were fabulous..Lovely clean restaurant...Would certainly recommend
"Only soup dumplings I´ve tried actually, but are they a treat! I don´t know if anyone else makes them, but i´m sure they can´t get any better. We made lines many times for this delicatessen."
"Been here a couple of times. It is always busy and it helps to shorten the waiting time for a table by speaking mandarin. 

The Shanghai style dumplings are the best We have had outside Shanghai. It would have been a five if the rest of the food had the same quality, the other dishes were good to really good but not excellent. We tried duck, Kung pao chicken, noodles, and more. The dish that should make you come here is the dumpling. 

The place is fully packed, noisy, you might need to remind the staff to get all you asked for. 

The price is good. 

I will come again. 

You should come here if you want great Shanghai dumplings and share a dish or two as variation on the side. 

You should not come here if you want starched napkins, a quiet atmosphere and to be guaranteed to have your own secluded table."
We tried this place thanks to a Friend that lives in New York City. The best dumblings in New York!!!! Also Sea Food noodles and Spring Rolls were GREAT!!!!!! BIG PORTIONS!!!! And Low Prices!!!!!!!! GREAT PLACE!!!!! AAA+
"2 of us for later lunch (2pm). Very busy, but seated in reasonable time at table for 5 with one other couple. Service was reasonably polite and timely although my entree was served 15 minutes after my husband's. Portions were generous, but  food was nothing special so not sure what all the hype is about. Maybe we failed to order something for which they are particularly known?"
"Dumplings were delicious, but caution if you're traveling with a party of eight! When we arrived there were only 3 people ahead of us and thought the wait was not much longer. 20 minutes later people started lining up after us w/parties of 2, 3 & 4's and all got seated as we continued to wait out in the cold. After waiting for 40 minutes we finally got seated on a tiny round table, cramped! The hostess gave a party of 5 a table for 9 and later added a party of 4 to it!!! I understand the restaurant wanting to fill every seat, but to wait for a specific table for 8 after 40 minutes of waiting is ridiculous!!! Better management for accommodating customers is much needed. Hostess was not very helpful and lack experience!!!"
"I love this restaurant. The food is amazing. The killers are the long waits, sharing tables with complete strangers, and the generally bad attitude of the staff, a problem encountered as soon as you walk in and have to practically beg to get on the waitng list! 

The servers are no better. They take your order (with an attitude), bring it and practically throw it on the table, and often get it wrong! Is this supposed to be what the restaurant's idea of service is? Maybe it's a cultural thing and I am misunderstanding?

While all of these issues are detrimental, the food makes up for what they lack. I have had good Chinese food elsewhere, but Joe's is damned good! This is why I continue returning here and expose myself to the bad treatment."
"The dumplings are as good as advertised, as well as the food. The only issue is it is always so crowded that it can become uncomfortable, as you have to share large tables with others"
"Long line but they're extremely fast (they were serving 87, we were 19 and we waited just 30 minutes). You sit with other persons, which I usually like. There was a moment I was running away disgusted for dirty (they clean tables with tea from other customers' cups) but then the dumplings, soup and noodles arrive, and you forget everything! Huge portions, only 20 $ each. A legend."
"My wife wanted some dumplings Chinese soup. We actually ate a lot of places in New York haha, we just did not want to miss out! SO we eventually pigged out LOL!!! Anyways this soup she ordered it for her, I had some, I ate most of it that's how good this stuff was!!! Go and check them out when you're in New York city!!"
"We got there about 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait about 25 minutes to get our table. There were 2 of us and we were seated at a table with 3 other persons. It is a small, crowded space!!
As suggested here we ordered our dumplings the minute we sat down. We then ordered 2 scallion pancakes. Both were fantastic!!!"
Had food mid-afternoon mid-week. Although the restaurant was half empty & there were about 7 staff it took forever to get served - despite catching the eye of most off the staff. Completely indifferent approach to taking our order & bringing food. They forgot one dish but seeing how badly they coped with someone else complaining (the manager walked away from them & left 2 other waiters dealing with it badly) we didn't complain! The waiters seemed much more concerned with interacting with each other than the customers. Such a shame because the food was good they just let the side down. I really think that 1 good waiter could have replaced them all!! They are obviously riding on their reputation & have got sloppy & complacent. And this was reflected in the fact the service was included in the bill rather than letting you choose what to tip - we would have refused to tip!
"We had dinner, we had high expectations but were disappointed. Ordering for a vegetarian was difficult. The Peking Duck was not as good as in other places we ate before. The dumplings were very good."
"This place is famous for its ""soup dumplings"" and lived up to its hype.  After walking down what appears to be a glorified alley off the beaten paths of Chinatown, this unassuming store front reveals a nice sized and crowded dining area.  You may find yourself seated family style with strangers.  It's NY.  Deal with it!  I found it useful so I can observe how to properly eat the specialty dumplings!  DELICIOUS and fun to eat!"
"I think this location is better than the Flushing location.  Their dumplings are absolutely amazing.  Order them first or else you'll have to wait a while to get them.  The crab meat dumplings are the best.  Make sure you don't lose the soup inside.

The salt and pepper pork chops are very good as well.  We usually order 2 dumplings and noodles to share.  

Be prepared to wait though, especially on Friday nights and weekends.  If you're willing to share a table, it will be quicker."
"Expect a wait ! But it will be worth it, seating is cafeteria style so expect to share your table with strangers. The soup dumplings are of course the ""star of the show"" and live up to expectations. We find that two orders between the three of us and two additional dishes were more than adequate. We had the chicken / black mushroom and bamboo and the General Tsao's chicken. I know that the General's chicken is not authentic Chinese but I was a little disappointed, it was bland and overcooked.
This place is cash only which seemed to catch a few diners out so go prepared. Prices are fairly reasonable overall - lunch for three comes out at about $45."
"You will probably have to wait 20-30 minutes to get in, it is very popular. The food is worth the wait: we had the signature dumplings (pork and crab) followed by chicken gung pao and shredded beef. Just don't expect cleanliness or friendly service and don't even think about going to the bathroom..."
A very busy Chinese - where you sit at round tables with other diners. The food is to die for especially the dumplings - had the best crispy beef too. Not a leisurely lunch as turnover is speedy but worth a visit
"Whilst the main meals themselves were ok the reason people come here and queue are the soup dumplings but these were very disappointing. Everyone seemed to be ordering them given the restaurants reputation but they were lukewarm, pretty tasteless and wrapped in a skin that was too thick and more like shop bought dim sum which is a shame when the secret of good dim sum is the thinness of its skin.

The rest of the meal was ok but nothing special. Actually quite liked the place itself with the communal tables and its sightly frantic nature. Expect to wait for a table. We put our names down and were told 40 minutes but in the end probably only waited 25. However it certainly wasn't worth the wait. Given the choice of restaurants in the area I'd seek out another recommendation next time."
"Food was authentic and delicious. Fresh food, very reasonable. Cash only, so no credit cards but that wasn't a problem for us. Definitely would go back."
"I read reviews and was curious about this spot in China Town. It is a favourite for actors like Jake Gyllenhaal and Jonah Hill so it has a reputation. It was hands down the best meal I had in New York. Great buzz inside, you share a table with strangers, but that way you get to meet new people. Service was excellent and it was the best Chinese food I have ever tasted. We didn't book in advance and only waited 10 minutes for a table. Considering we ordered a few rounds of beers, ordered 5 starters and 5 main courses, the bill only came to £20 per head. Unbelievable value. 5 star, and I will definitely go back when I'm in New York."
"Located in a very small street right in the middle of China Town in NYC. A good indication : it' full but the wait is reasonable because everybody is seated at 10 people large round tables. If you are for a romantic dinner this is not the place to go !
As usual, very extensive menu where one can find what he or she likes. Everything is very good, warm and quickly brought to  the table.
A little expensive, cash only."
"I was walking around Chinatown and saw a line forming, waiting for the place to open up.  I haven't had lunch yet and I figured if there's a line, then it's good enough for me.  I sat with strangers (hostess will seat you to fill the table)  It's a small and business establishment.  I just ordered dumplings.  It was good.  Came in about 10-15 minutes."
"The ""as advertised"" very good dumplings and Chinese fare aren't worth the effort.  After being told it would be a 40 minute wait, my family of 5 had to wait for over an hour to be seated.  It was like that episode of Seinfeld.  By the time our number was finally called, we were starving.  To my surprise it was cafeteria seating.  We sat with 6 other people at a huge round table.  Not the dining experience I had hoped for.  We wanted to talk about our day in a relaxed atmosphere over, what was reported to be, really good food.  We felt rushed by the waiter to order.  Note to owners - hand menus to folks waiting outside so they have time to look things over.  The waiter seemed to like where I was seated as he delivered all the orders from there, reaching in front of me to pass and retrieve plates from a lazy Susan, fill water glasses, etc.  An armpit in my face while dining isn't pleasant.  In the end, the crab and pork soup dumplings were very good as were the Sesame Chicken and Lo Mein.  Sans the dumplings, the portions were on the less than average size and there is an extra charge for a small bowl of rice.  The prices were fair but all in all, not worth the effort."
It was a little hard to find.  But the food was worth it!!  The Soup Dumplings are wonderful.  The broccoli beef was amazing.  Great service!
"We were sent by a local to have the Shanghai Soup Dumplings. Best we have had since eating them in Shanghai!
Our  version of brunch and all the additional dishes were great. Bring cash as they take no credit cards and you might find yourself sharing a table with another family  but it was great fun."
"We went here on advice of a friend, who thought this place was great.  We got there 1/2 hr wait, thought ok it must be that good. Finally got a table and ordered, we finished and decided that we had better in Shanghai restaurants in Toronto.  Was it worth the wait? Nope, didn't think so."
"It's mad busy, the servers super quick and not the easiest to get help from, you have to wait for ages for a table to end up squashed and sharing, can only pay with cash, there's only one loo with a massive queue, could do with a really good clean - BUT it is a fantastic experience! 

The dumplings are of course excellent. We had four trays and ate them all. The stir fried beans and vegetables too were really good. 

We had a lot of fun, felt like we were back in China - it's a great experienced not to be missed in Chinatown New York!"
"I went to the restaurant for lunch to have their Pork Soup Dumplings. I thought that eating all eight dumplings would not be filling but it was. They were so flavorful, I might be thinking about them for the next few days. The best way to eat the dumplings is to pick one up with the chopsticks and place it on your spoon. If you pick it up with the prongs they give you, you may put a hole in it and let some of the broth out. Then take a small bite out of it, creating a hole to be able to suck some broth out of it. After sucking a small amount of broth out, it is ready to be eaten. They were $5.95 for an order of 8 dumplings. They add the tip to the bill and THEY DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS.  See my photos below."
"Quality of food very low , dumplings are not that good even fried rice was dry schezuan spicy beef is not spicy or hot
Waiters the rudest and most grumpy ever encountered in a restaurant , no water offered forgot our quail argued about our selection so arrogant and abrupt
We told the cashier but she couldn't give a stuff
Never never never again"
"Nothing wrong to say about the food, delicious, but the waiter in charge of my table must learn or have an intensive training where someone teach to him how treat a customer, and tip shouldn't be included as it is, they should deserve it."
"Soup dumplings are a Shanghai specialty and nowhere are they more like those in Shanghai than at this Chinatown landmark.  Soup dumplings are normal steamed pork dumplings with pork broth injected into the middle of the dumpling.  When you bite on the dumpling, the soup comes out (sometimes it shoots out and can be very hot, so  beware!) and moistens the meat and pasta exterior making for a very delicious taste.  We have eaten soup dumplings at many American Chinese restaurants as well as in China, and these rank with the best."
"I read in Time Out that this actress's favorite dish was the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai. When I arrived, there was a short line. I gave my name and since I was alone got in quickly. It is communal dining, and they don't take credit cards, only cash. It is a small, noisy place with waiters running around and not much ""atmosphere"". You sit, they give you a letter and take your order. I got a Tzing Tao beer and the dumplings, which were either crabmeat or pork. I got the pork. I would have liked to try other things, an Asian family near me got scallion pancakes, General Tso's chicken and a noodle dish and it all looked good. I drank my beer and before long my dumplings, in a steamer basket, arrived with soy sauce and julienned ginger. There was also hot sauce. The dumpling were shaped like flowers, with a little give on the outside and the soupy filling on the inside. I watched the way a fellow diner at the dumplings. She took a bite and then put the soy sauce and hot sauce in the opening of the dumpling and ate. The dumplings were $5.25, my beer $5- it was the cheapest meal I got in New York."
We had picked out Joe's as the place we would end up after a morning exploring downtown. Pleased with that choice. The ambience and service are cheap and cheerful but the food was great.
"I travel from Switzerland twice a year to eat Joe’s soup dumplings.

I spend a quarter of my time in Asia and I still believe that this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the world…"
"The menu is amazing but narrow it down to the dumplings! It is the most delicious dish ever! Bite then, drink the liquid inside and then eat!!! 1 order is big enough for two. If you are not used to sharing a table well you are in for a big surprise! Yes, tables are shared but it is all part of the experience.
Great place for authentic Chinese food!"
"Anyone saying the place is ""dirty"" or staff ""rude"" etc...not familiar with Chinese culture. This place is always packed, with a wait...for good reason. Have eaten there many times & the food is awesome....but the soup dumplings are AMAZING. The main attraction! Last time we (party of 3 - 1 a 10 year old!) ate 4 orders (8 dumplings each) in record time :) Delicious. Green tea - free pot for your party. Now they also serve orange slices - also free! Good Luck! Fu! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place...can't say enough. You don't get much more reasonably priced food than Chinatown in Manhattan! Go in...get a number...hang around. Down the street a bit is a new Crepe place - great for dessert & bubble tea! Chinatown IceCream Factory is close by as well. Just GO! A++++++++"
"Don't understand the hype. The place was crowded and dirty. The food was ok I guess, but not in any way deserving the acclaim it has got in the media etc. 

The staff don't speak english, the toilet didnt work and we left with out finishing our meal. Best thing to say: at least we didn't get food poisining ;)"
"Recommended by a New York  resident, we ventured down to Chinatown for a delicious dinner. We had a not-too-long 20 minute wait and were seated at a communal table. Our food came quickly and everything was delicious. We ordered Kung pao chicken, Singapore noodles and a squid dish.  Yum!"
"Great Dumplings, tasty duck, great noodle soup. I've been to the original in Shanghai and it tastes just as authentic along with the atmosphere! Great for couples to a large group. Worth the wait on line, even in sub zero temp."
"Here's the thing....People come here for the delicious soup dumplings.  And only the soup dumplings.  The other dishes are ok, but no better than any other Chinese restaurant you've ever been to.  So, GET THE DUMPLINGS.  At lunch, you get a basket of 8 dumplings for $9, so it's a delicious and inexpensive meal (inexpensive food being a rarity in NYC).  That being said, if you're not a fan of dumplings, this is probably not the restaurant for you.

I visit this restaurant every time I'm in NYC, and I love it."
"If you're an Aussie visiting give this place a wide berth. It will make you feel homesick for decent Chinese cooking. 
It's crowded and service is rushed and abrupt.
Seafood combination dishes were made up of seafood extender. I've never seen this done in any self respecting Chinese restaurant. 
Absolute disappointment. Oh and the NYC food rating is still 'pending' hardly an endorsement."
"Best Dumpings in Town - this place got recommended to us by more than 5 people so we had to come and try. In central China Town, the line system is a bit crazy and if you are a couple you will more than likely be sat with another couple or a family on the same table but this just adds to the craziness and the charm of the place. The food is worth waiting for!"
This place has the best dumplings we've ever eaten!  We STILL think about them and look forward to our next visit.  It's a very busy restaurant and worth the wait.
"We visited during rush hours and the place was crowded, yet the quick service made it possible. We had the soup dumplings which were good. Than a fried rice with no taste at all... Overall good experience but you can find cheaper and better food around."
"We go everytime we travel to NYC.  This time the staff was nasty.  The bathrooms were filthy and the food was marginal.  If you want the house specialty which is steamed dumplings - ask for dumplings in soup, not steamed, or you will get bland, mushy dumplings thrown on a plate.  So disappointing."
"This place was so different from what we were expecting, first the neighborhood feels like walking through Beijing street and then there is that place with delicious dishes ! The staff is not really friendly but the food is great and the portions are huge, go there we will travel!"
"We sought this place out based on recommendations and weren't disappointed. I've heard some so-so-stories about their other dishes, but we stuck entirely to dumplings and they were all fantastic."
"I would have rated this five 'stars,' but the sweet and sour chicken was so nasty that even four 'stars' is a bit generous.

Appetizers: We ordered plenty of pork soup dumplings as an appetizer, and they were delicious--I mean, just plain fab. The key is to dive in, bite off the top, and then sip out the broth. Do not attempt to look cool, hip, or dignified. Just go for it!

Main course: We ordered fried rice, sesame chicken, and sweet and sour chicken to share among four people. Fried rice and sesame chicken were delish. Sweet and sour chicken was just plain awful.

Even now, hours later, I can't figure out why a kitchen or cook would allow something so icky to go out the door. The 'chicken' was simply breaded and fried chicken skin. Unfortunately, it was the last thing delivered to our table and the last thing I sampled, so I left with my gag reflex barely in check. So disappointed. Everything else was so heavenly; it was a bummer to leave on such a bad note.

The atmosphere is as noisy and hectic as everyone else mentions and is a matter of personal preference. We happen to love it. Others may not.

Joe's is cash only, and not particularly cheap, so be sure to take a big wad of twenties if you're going as a family or group.

Summary: Order plenty of soup dumplings. Steer way WAY clear of the sweet and sour chicken."
There was a huge line when we got there. We went and got a number and waited until it was called. It was worth waiting outside and getting rained on. The soup dumplings are delicious. Also had the green beans and fried meat.
"Go for the soup dumplings.  Yes, wait in the ridiculously long line (it moves fast).  Don't expect to stretch out, this is a very busy and very cramped restaurant, but the soup dumplings alone make it worth it!"
"We stopped by Joe's for yummy soup dumplings. The restaurant was crowded despite it being 2:30pm. They seated us at a large round table with another group -- this isn't the place for a romantic date -- and served us fabulous soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and a delicious shrimp/broccoli dish that the waiter suggested when we asked for a recommendation. This place is true Chinese, so don't expect American style service; just enjoy the proper dumplings :-)"
"Party of 4 ate there this evening, July 1, 2015, based on reviews on TripAdvisor.
Excellent find on the Soup Dumplings. Tasty and unique. We watched the YouTubes on how to eat and nobody scalded their mouth with exploding soup.

Should have ordered a few more and stopped. Shared a few non-memorable items. Shanghai noodles were extremely greasy. Don't order. One of our party (not a big Chinese food eater) ordered Moo Shu Pork: filling and hot, but also fairly greasy and not too flavorful.

We agree with the majority of reviewers that the Soup Dumplings were worth the wait.  But save room for desert around the corner at Beautiful Memory Desserts with refreshing fruit and tofu and tapioca concoctions to die for.  Look for my review for some notes."
"Looked it up at tripadvisor and they weren't wrong the ratings were right on. Fresh tasting and fresh looking. Love the soop dum,plings"
"Awesome food, very very good place to fill up on fresh food and not cost alot. Can be a wait depending on your group size and time of day and which day. Well worth it"
Soupy dumplings are the best but other dishes are excellent too. Service is steady and reliable while to atmosphere is okay. Prices are very reasonable.
"The dumplings were delicious! We also got scallion pancake which was very yummy also.  We were a party of 4 and sat with 3 other strangers.  It was a great experience. The prices were reasonable for NYC too.  They include a service fee no matter what so unless you want to tip more than 15%, then you are all set.  When you get the bill, they bring over orange slices as well. I would definitely go back!  The only thing that was annoying is you felt like you were being rushed. They were constantly cleaning your table and hovering.  But, I get why - the place is constantly busy!"
"The problem was that we went there not really hungry. The only thing we could eat were the steamed dumplings and it was a bullseye. The waiter instructed us how we should eat them, they were delicious. We also got hot tea, but the heat outside did not encourage me to drink it. Paradoxically, after drinking a few tiny cups, the heat stopped bothering me. When we were leaving, I saw what the others had on their tables, and my eyes would eat that right away!"
"Walked in to get our name on the waiting list and the hostess had a rude tone to wait outside after I asked her how come the empty table wasn't being used. All she said was ""No!"" Food was okay. It's cash only and they don't tell you that nicely, either. They include a 15% service charge no matter how many people are on the table. I guess they don't want people tipping based on their service, which is pretty much giving you water and taking your order. You're in the food and customer service business, be nice to your customers!"
"I reviewed this place a year ago, but we were back last night and it's still one of the best in Chinatown. We were a large family group so I got to sample many dishes and all were excellent. Other than the food the restaurant is typical Chinatown, meaning that the service is efficient but brusque and the ambiance aged luncheonette.  But the prices are excellent, the food is outstanding, and that's Chinatown. Highly recommended."
"Good thing I had just visited the ATM....

We stumbled into this place after finding it on Yelp as we were walking around. We did order the pork soup dumplings, but neither of us knew how to eat them or that they had hot broth inside. Oh well! After I poked mine with my chopsticks, I got a scolding lecture from an older Italian man at the next table (which was about 1 inch from our table but you know how they seat parties verrrry closely in NYC), about how I shouldn't have poked it, how I should eat it in one piece and let it explode in my mouth, ya da ya da. Seriously, how rude, and him not even being Chinese made it worse! I told him I was hungry and the dumplings were too hot to eat whole... I was humiliated (in a somewhat amusing way) into eating the next one whole, and promptly regretted it when it exploded very hot broth into my mouth! And of course, this being a Chinese restaurant, there was no water on the table, just HOT tea. LOL!

I had the beef and broccoli (not feeling very adventurous) and it was average. My friend had some kind of duck and did not think it was very good. We probably would not go back."
"Steamed pork dumplings is the name of the game. How do they get broth as well as minced pork inside those dumplings? They are uniform enough to convince me there is a secret machine back in the kitchen...! Regardless, I've been going there for years, just for the dumplings, occasionally for something else as well: most what one orders will be at least satisfactory, though I have not tasted everything on the long menu by any means. The dumplings, crispy duck (yeah!), and at least some others rate 5 stars. Prices are low to reasonable. However, one has to wait outside the restaurant for a seat, most times, even if it rains. Seats & tables are packed. Service is quick but impersonal & one feels pressured to eat & get out, even if only looks speak. The noise level is stratospheric. And it is cash only, no cards. Still, the place has been a regular over the years... and I enjoy walking through Chinatown: bargains, anyone? But be VERY careful!"
"Popped in for lunch midweek and was able to get a table right away. Good thing since a line started forming after we were seated. They bring you tea right off the bat and seem to want to get you in and out quickly. That's okay since we don't like lounging around when we see a wait. Had delicious soup dumplings (I guess what can be considered their signature dish), along with some pancakes and potstickers. One of our guidebooks recommended this place, and it did not disappoint. Tip: bring cash since they don't take credit cards."
Ok so we watched the youtube instructional video and thought what a self promoting blah blah. No really this dumpling is incredible! Great food all the way around but you must get the soup dumplings for your starter. some of the best food Chinatown has to offer. Will definitely make this an always go back place when in NYC.
"You can't miss the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai if you're in Chinatown. Not only do they taste absolutely incredible, but the prices are also so reasonable. It's also neat to see the pictures of celebrities who have eaten there. It's such a small unassuming little restaurant tucked into a side street in Chinatown, but it seriously cannot be missed!"
"Stopped by on a Tuesday for Lunch.  I have eaten here before when I lived in NY but this is my first time back since moving out of the city (to Florida).  Don't expect a standard Chinese menu that you see in the suburbs.  Almost everything on the menu may be somewhat unfamiliar, but most of the items are good.  
Soup dumplings with crab and pork are the must have item here.  They can't be eaten like regular dumplings - you need to place them on a spoon, bite off the top of the dumpling and carefully sip out the soup (it's hot) before chewing into the rest of the dumpling.  Its a unique experience and can also be enhanced by the soy/vinegar dipping sauce or the spicy chili paste on the table.
We also ordered the braised duck and crispy sea bass.  Both were excellent.  Our waiter separated the duck from its bones and did the same for the fish, just like in a fancier restaurant.  The duck was very most in a savory sauce with the meat falling off the bones accompanied by some good steamed baby bok choy.  Only the skin was a little fatty, the rest was very meaty and delicious.  The fish was deep fried and covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce.  Its was hard not to pick the meat off of the bones after eating the fleshy part of the fish. 
All in all it was a very satisfying meal costing the two of us $60 with service charge.  Not cheap but in NYC not too expensive."
"The pork soup dumplings are the best I've ever had.
Juiciest ever! Perfectly cooked. I ate a whole tray myself."
The wait time was not to bad for a holiday; they are very strict about everyone in your party being on line with you before you are seated. The restaurant does not accept credit cards only cash
"It was the first time I had the soup dumplings, and I loved them! They are basically like normal dumplings, but with soup filling! Very delicious!! A nice gentleman sitting next to us (we were seated on a round table with strangers, which was kind of fun), explained to us how to best eat those dumplings (-take them with the spoon, bite off the top so the steam can go off, and then slurp the soup from the inside of the dumpling:). The two of us shared these as an appetizer (8 pieces for ca. 5$), which was a great deal. 
As a main course I chose the chicken & scampi with plum sauce. I was expecting something sweeter, but nevertheless it tased good (not 'wow' or special, but average good). And note that the portions are quite big (at least for an European) - so if you're not exactly starving, I would recommend to share a main meal."
"We acme with a friend who insisted this was the best Chinese restaurant in China Town. She is definitely wrong! It's NOT a good restaurant and there are definitely better Chinese restaurants in China Town.

The restaurant is overcrowded. You just can't eat comfortably. We had to wait almost 30 minutes just to get in. 

The food quality is mediocre. Some items were ok, some good, most less than good. Prices are average to China Town. Service is fast."
"This is one of the must eats in NYC - the Soup Dumplings are of course divine. Quite liked the Shanghai noodles as well, have been looking for these thick dark noodles for a while now."
Small venue.  Crowded but worth it.  Inexpensive.  Quite the experience.  Very New York.   Lunch is easier to get a table.  Expect to stand in line for dinner.
"This was a big disappointment. Perhaps the dumplings are superb which we did not order but the rest was really below average. The drunken chicken was not 'drunken' enough. The fried rice too greasy. The pancakes tasteless. The noodles too dry. The service was bad, rude. We enjoyed the Shanghai manor house more."
Used to be exceptional; bit long wait with tourists and decline of quality of food.  May suggest less crowded nearby newer Shanghinese restaurants!
"This restaurant was highly recommended by previous visitors and we were well advised!   We went mid afternoon, which I would recommend...about 2:30 pm -4:00 pm. No wait, seated with others at a community table which made for great chit chat.  We ordered the soup dumplings, fried rice and General Tso's chicken.   Very authentic, flavors very true and worthy of the praise.  They only take cash, no credit cards, so be prepared.   Pricing is reasonable, so that makes it easy.  The service is very rote, but friendly."
"We had dinner at Joe's his evening. We waited about 30 mins to get seated, and when we did, we share a table with another family. Seems to be the system of seating at Joe's. So the food is OK... The green beans were ok, fried pork dumplings were good. I didn't have the pork soup dumplings, but heard they were good. Overall, not sure it's worth the wait or cozy dining.

Oh AND they don't take credit cards..."
"The service is not the reason you go to Joe's Shanghai.   They are not overly friendly,  slow ... and seemed very put out.   However, I can look past that because the food is that good.    If you like dumplings, please try their Soup Dumplings .. they are incredible!   Everything else is very authentic Chinese and delicious."
"My friend was basically pushing me to come to this place because of the dumplings. ok , i said , let's do this. Afterward, he told me that it's not a fine dine restaurant so it's more casual ( I have eaten to Hakkasan and a bunch of fine dine Asian restaurants quite often ) . Actually , yes , the place is more like a room, with just round tables which can sit 12 people each and they basically need to make you eat and go in the shortest  time they can.they don't accept reservations, the line is always long and there are always people standing just inside the door so even when you get the  call trying to get in the room actually is an adventure lol. The front girl door is like a SS police officer who is in charge to Handle the customers. The place is packed and crowded, not really clean and the waiters are like "" ok sit down , order your food and get out of here "". They don't speak English so all your attempts to try to get an advise are a waste of time. The dumplings are really really good and we basically ate 4 dumplings containers in less then 15 minutes !! I ordered the beef and scallion and it was pretty good . The funny part was that I had to recognise by myself what was my food since they brought everything together and we were in 7 people and actually you don't understand anything of what they say LOL. It's also not very cheap: I ate an entrée and few dumplings , no alcohol , just the tea the serve for free: 27 $ tax and tips included. We split the check however we all had taken the food in the same price range plus 4 beers and couple of soft drinks. I am fair : I was not expecting a fine dine experience so overall the experience was funny: the way they treat the costumers is so funny, the food is pretty good and the place is ..... characteristic ! It is like a fine dine restaurant but on the opposite side : go there once in a while if you don't want waste your salary in 1 week ; in this case , go there just for the funny experience and decent food . If I go back , it's just for fun and have a different dining experience."
"We had a superb lunch here. The service is quick, friendly, and practical. You get seated at big table with other folks which is fun, though we did not make conversation with the people at our table, so it still felt like a real date for us. We ordered the mushroom and baby cabbage heart (baby bok choy) as well as the spicy fried shrimp with meat sauce, which was garnished with lightly cooked broccoli. Both dishes were beautiful to look at, perfectly executed, and completely delicious. The five Korean women who were added to our table later thought our food looked so good that they went ahead and included those same dishes in their order. An older gentleman sitting next to us had a beautiful soup and we also saw other diners eating beautiful dumplings. We just ate there yesterday but may go back again today for lunch!"
"We were in ChinaTown during a weekend trip to NYC and had heard good things about Joe's so we figured we would give it a try.  

We waited outside for about 30 minutes (for 2 people) and then escorted to a table with many other diners.  Completely unexpected.  You sit with lots of others and everyone is in different parts of their meals.  We ordered the duck soup dumplings and they were fantastic.  Different type of dumpling than I had before but so delicious.  There is a trick to eating these so make sure that the waiters help you out. 

We also ordered the beef broccoli.  Meat was very tender and the broccoli had a lot of flavor.   We requested a side of roasted vegetables (which was mostly broccoli) but still very tasty.

It took a little getting used to the fast pace and dining set up at Joe's but it was worth the visit.  Highly recommend!  

ONLY CASH!!!"
"We visited Joe's Shanghai during our visit in April. The restaurant has an old-style Shanghai look to it: a bit worn off, people seated together, staff a bit aloof mostly talking together: nothing you wouldn't experience in China either...
BUT: the food is second to none: the dumplings outstanding - it had been years since I tasted xialongbao this good and their noodles are outstanding. We took a plate of ginger chicken that was fantastic.
Yes, the waiters are a bit grumpy but they will help you with anything you ask (we asked for a chopstick holder for our daughter and got it right away)."
"Everytime I come to New York,  I make a point of meandering through Chinatown to Pell Street and order a basket of crab meat soup dumplings. I think it's gotten to a point where I order an entire basket to myself because it's too good to share with others.  Over the years, the quality of the soup dumplings has held up and has not disappointed.  On my last visit, I didn't like the stir fried rice cake but their noodles were good.

If you don't want to stand in line,  I advise not to come during lunch or dinner. Usually have no trouble with seating between 2-4pm."
"CASH ONLY! When we got there the line of people waiting was on the mini sidewalk. We were  a party of 10 and waited about 25 minutes. This place is small and jammed with tables so don't get offended by rubs and bumps of people passing (depending on where you sit). We ordered 3 servings of the boiled dumplings with 2 different stuffings. Simply delicious, flavorful, soft, melting in my mouth goodness. The scallion pancakes was a pleasant surprise, lightly fried. We shared others plates and the food was good but the dumplings made the meal. Next time I'll just ordered dumplings and scallion pancakes. The waiter was knowledgable and basic, supplied all our needs and kept the food coming."
"Yes, you line up.  Yes, they only take cash.  Yes, it has now been firmly established on the tourist trail.  Yes, it has the ambience of a bus station.  Yes, the waiters are impatient (but not rude, not quite).  But it is authentic, it never changes, and it is GOOD!"
"First went to Joe's on a recommendation 20 years ago. This time we brought the whole family. Long line, so went in and took a ticket then walked around for 20 mins. Came back and went straight in. Crab & Pork soup dumplings (learn to eat them properly to avoid scalds!!) Fabulous prawns and scallops, best fried rice in the world. Not the best decor, but great staff (apart from the 'ticket girl, but who cares). Just try it."
"There's a greater sense of 'Take it or Leave it' here than in most restaurants. 

The number of returnees shows it is a restaurant and an experience works, but for a first time visitor, being seated at a shared table for 11 or 12, on the far side of the table from the waiter, makes it harder to ask any questions, should you have any, as you will be talking over an entire table..

There are plus points to the arrangement. You see other dishes at the table. You could talk to other diners (if that's your thing).

The food was just fine. I may have missed out on whether it was noticeably better than any other food of its' type, so I guess it's about the experience?"
"This place came highly recommended to us for their Pork Dumplings and they did not disappoint. We started with the Appetizers and ordered the Pork Fried and the Boiled Dumplings. You get 8 dumplings for $5.95 per order and both versions are delicious! We also ordered the Scallion Pancake which was very good as well and reminded us of the fritters we would eat back home. When you come into this small restaurant, you get seated at a large circular table along with another party or two unless you come with a group of more than say 8. Seating is family style and the décor is bright and even included multi-colored Christmas lights. The waiters are always rushing from table to table and may appear to be rushing the clientele along, but I just sat and savored my delicious meal. My brother-in-law ordered some Jumbo Prawns which were great! The advantage of eating with others is seeing what they ordered and discovering new food choices. Across from us sat a small group who ordered a wonderful looking dish that they said was Kung Pao Chicken along with Young Chow Fried Rice. We enjoyed our meal so much, we decided to return the following night and ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (which although listed as hot & spicy, you can ask they alter the spice to mild or according to your taste) and Young Chow Fried Rice which proved great along with more Dumplings and the Shanghai Fried Flat Noodles which were delicious. If in doubt, ask the staff for their recommendations as I did with the noodles and they will not steer you wrong. The end of the meal comes with a plate of sliced oranges to cleanse your palate and it was very refreshing. We visited two nights in a row and wished we could’ve come more, but only in town for two nights. Relatively inexpensive, given the amount/quality of the food, I would definitely highly recommend anyone who wants a great meal in NYC to come and discover this little gem. Please be aware they do not accept credit cards, cash only."
I have had dumplings in other Chinese restaurants but none could compare to Joe's Shanghai.  Go early to avoid a wait for table.
"Since Joe's has the best soup dumplings in the city, we often bring out-of-town guests, arriving at 11:00 AM on the weekend to ensure we get seated. (By 11:30 AM on Saturday morning, there was a line out the door.) The food was great as usual, especially the soup dumplings. But for the second time in recent weeks, although they take the dumpling order first, they served entrees before the dumplings arrived. Come on, Joe's. Maintain your professionalism!"
"Take the soup dumplings, which have soup and either pork or crab meat inside. We only had the pork dumplings and they tasted very good. Bite a little hole in the dumpling and blow inside, it’s hot..Tea and water are for free, the seating is at large round tables, good for meeting new people."
"My first ever restaurant in Canal Street, I was introduced to the world of Chinese food. I cannot promise if what I had was 100% authentic.. but then who cares..
Its a communal dining scenario and the waiter comes and asks how many.. How many boxes of the soup filled dumplings.. who knew that would be heaven on earth..
Although I burnt my tongue a bit with the first bite.. and the soup oozed out of the dumplings, the rest of what was remaining of my taste buds burst into bliss.."
"If you have never had Joes soup dumplings, make the trip!!! Can't say much about the rest of the food as we feast on one thing only, delicious dumplings filled with pork or crab and a tangy soup broth. One of the top 5 things I have ever put in my mouth! 
Decor is tacky and it's crowded as is every authentic restaurant in Chinatown or this would be a 5 star for sure"
"The first time we tried to eat here the line was 50-75 feet long.  Our second try (and last) there were only about 10-12 people ahead of us.  We were told the wait would be ten minutes which turned into 30 minutes (no exaggeration).  With the outside temperature below zero we stuffed ourselves along with the others waiting on line into a tiny hallway. People from the upstairs residences kept coming and going, adding to the discomfort. They don't take cash so I had to run out to a nearby ATM.  You eat at crowded, communal tables, in a room with the ambiance of a factory lunchroom.  Waiters are not friendly.  OK you say, but for great food you can put up with a lot.  After we left I told my wife that we have had much better food at local Chinese restaurants.  She not only agreed but added that some Chinese buffets we ate at were also better.  We shared three appetizers none of which were anything special. We did not have the steamed dumplings which is their specialty but I don't care how good they can be.  It could never overcome all of the other negatives."
"Joe's was recommended to us by some friends that are from New York so we gave it a try. It's off of a side street in Chinatown so it doesn't look like a place you would make a point to go to, but you totally should!

The Soup Dumplings are the star... and you have to get them! They really are amazing and live up to all of the hype...

A few takeaways from our dinner there...

There is always a wait... which makes sense after you eat there... but there are 3 other options on the street that have no wait... don't let the wait deter you... it's worth it! That said, it can look confusing... I assume a lot of the people that eat there are regulars so they know the system... It looks like you just get in line when you walk up, but you have to go inside and get a ticket/number... the ""hostess"" is not overly friendly... but oh well... it's super busy... Once you have your number, stay close... they yell them out pretty quick and move on to the next one...

If you are a party of 2 you may end up sitting super close to another party of 2... is what it is...

The servers assume you know everything you need to know about the food and the ordering process so be ready! Order your soup dumplings when you sit down... and the rest of the food is big enough to share.

They are quick to clear your table when you look to be done so be aware of that... they have to flip the tables... people are waiting...

We looked up ""How to eat soup dumplings?"" Sounds silly but it totally helped... there is soup inside the dumplings... so you can't just bite them... put them in your spoon, pierce the top, sip the soup and add the sauce... 

One last thing... I'm pretty sure it's Cash Only... the closest ATM is in a nail salon a few doors down!

Seems like a lot of work but it really is worth it... and it actually made it kind of fun!"
"Let's face it, this place doesn't look like much.  Using the bathroom will not make you too happy either.  But the food will put a smile on your face.  There is a reason this place has long lines on weekends.   They are famous for their soup dumplings, which you must order of you come here. The other dishes are also all good.  I've never had a bad dish here.   If you are a s smaller party, you might end up sharing a table with some strangers.  That's not a bad thing as you can meet some interesting people that way.  You might also get to taste some food they ordered that you weren't sure you would like.  I've been here multiple times and I keep coming back because the food is good and the prices are very reasonable.  

Service is brusque, but don't take it personal.  Everyone gets treated the same way.  Basically they want you to order, eat quickly, pay and then leave so that they can get the next group in.  If you find yourself on a super long line and you are really hungry and don't want to wait, just walk to the next block and go into Joe's Ginger.  Same owners, same food but with no crowds.

On more thing to keep in mind.  They only take cash, so make sure you have enough before you enter."
"We didn't venture down to Chinatown for French restaurant opulence or service.  We wanted a genuine Chinatown experience and excellent Chinese food, and we weren't disappointed.  The ambiance was authentic, not touristy, and the food was outstanding.  Lots of locals (always a good sign), crowded (but not unpleasantly so), and did I mention the great food?  Apparently, the dumplings are a big draw, but I highly recommend the scallion pancakes for a starter.  We then got a rather unimaginative order of Kung pao chicken and General Tso's chicken.  More than we could possibly eat, but it was so tasty we almost finished it.  Prices we're very reasonable also.  Would absolutely go back, and highly recommend it."
I have never been to China but I find it hard to believe I could find any better soup dumplings than in this place. It's simply amazing! I would gladly travel across the Atlantic ocean many times just to enjoy these dumplings.
"Suggested by a guide, it was a very pleasant experience, I've been there two times and i can suggest you to go. The food is very good. See u next time."
I've waited for years to try this place - but never have had the time (or travel companion) to trek down to Chinatown. It was all that I imagined - and we lucked out and didn't have to wait on a Friday night. I think it was easier to seat us as we were just a party of two. The restaurant is not large and only has big round tables - so you sit with others. Not a big deal when you are two people as you can just huddle together. As all have said - the thing to order is pork soup dumplings and the chive onion pancake. The menu is vast - both of these items are on the appetizer section. The ladies that were sharing our table ordered the main dishes that seemed straight ahead 'american chinese'. Not the way to go. We paid about $9 a person for an order of the soup dumplings and pancakes each and we were packed. The perfect dinner on a cold winter night.
"Often long waits to get in. The staff is helpful but not friendly. Hard to get a private table. More likely you will be seated at a large round table with a bunch of strangers. Can get confusing knowing whose food is whose if anybody uses the large lazy susan which occupies probably 3/4 of the table. The soupy dumplings are good. the food is pretty good. I would have given the place 2 1/2 stars if that was an option. But, 'average' is an appropriate description."
"I had heard about this place for awhile and thought I should have my dinner there last night. When I walked by there was a huge crowd and I almost turned around and left. But, I though I might sneak in as a single. I did and was happy to finally try these famous dumplings.

They ask you right away if you want pork soup dumplings and they get to the table pretty quick. They are delicate little balls of goodness and the soup is inside the dumpling. You really just have to try it to know. 

I also had the General Tsao chicken (best bet!) and the moo shu. 

Space is classic Chinese and the service is quick and grim. Do not tip!!! It's included. Big point! 

Worth a visit, great place to meet other foodies."
"Like most others me & my fiancee went here based on other reviews & recommendations. We both wished we never went.
The restaurant was busy however we got a seat right away which we were soon to be sharing with another couple. 
The waiter could hardly speak english & he was telling me to order 1 of 2 starters...last time I checked how restaurants worked was I tell them what I want! After questioning him & being confused of his comments he simply about turned & walked away attending to another table! Yip you heard me right!
I noticed that all staff appeared to not have a care in the world. They treat customers like a factory line. Once I choose my starter it was admittingly delicious. Then whilst still eating my starter they gave me my main course. Come on!
Apart from the tasty food this place seems to thrive on word of mouth. It's a word of mouth I highly do NOT recommend."
"As soon as my bf and I walked in, we were seated right away. We ordered the soup dumplings to start, eggplant in garlic sauce, szechuan beef and two bowls of white rice. The soup dumplings were so succulent and full of flavor! We ended up ordering more soup dumplings. The eggplant was tender and the garlic sauce really complimented it. The szechuan beef was perfect and the sauce tasted so good over the white rice. This is the place to eat for delicious Chinese food in New York."
"Friends took me here for dinner. I had no idea what to expect. We beat the rush too! After we walked in there was a line out the door. I also didn't expect to share tables with other patrons. However, after getting over this, we had excellent soup dumplings at the most affordable price. We also had the beef and string beans. I want to go back for the soup dumplings!"
"Well, there is really a main reason I go to Joe's Shanghai - Soup dumplings. No New York trip is complete without a visit here. You will end up waiting in line for a while, but it is worth it and the big round tables usually mean you'll be seated with someone interesting."
"Very and consistently good quality food, ok atmosphere and service--better options around 38th and 5th or in Chinatown."
"Disappointed with our experience at Joe's Shanghai.  We came here based on the reviews on yelp, and expected more.  When we arrived, there was a long line of people waiting outside so we assumed the place must be great!  The wait time quoted was 30 minutes, however it took about 50 minutes to be seated and that is only because two parties ahead of us left.  

The establishment is small and dark.  The wall next to our table was splattered with food, and during our meal a roach crawled out from behind one of the pictures and walked across the wall above our table.  GROSS!!  So much to say about the wait staff.  For starters, my husband accidentally walked in on one of them using the single-use restroom, and the man finished urinating, did NOT wash his hands, and then served food to a nearby table.  Totally unsanitary!  Also, they bring the food out one order at a time, so you are not eating your meal together.  The last dish was brought to the table 25 minutes after the first dish, so 2 of the people were finished eating before the other 2 even started!  Lastly, they are very inattentive - you have to ask for absolutely everything multiple times (water, tea, napkin).  The restaurant automatically includes 15% tip and NY sales tax in your bill, so since the wait staff is guaranteed a 15% tip, there is no incentive for them to be attentive.  Also, be sure you bring cash!  There is no payment via credit or debit cards, cash only.

As for the food, the wontons and fried rice were outstanding!  They deserve 5 stars!!  The other food is nothing special.  Typical Chinese food you would get anywhere."
"First off, the service is horrible. It's so bad that there's a big sign on the wall that indicates - no matter how many people are in your party - a automatic 18% tip is added to each bill.  That should have been a huge warning sign.  I've never seen a restaurant state this for everyone, not just 6 or more in a party.  So we wait - and the place was hopping & busy!  Then we are shoved into a table with a bunch of other people we don't know.  I realize this is normal for many other places.  And the restaurant handles it fairly well giving each party a number for their seating area.  Personally I think they could run the restaurant more efficiently with 4 and 2 seater tables.  

The waiter gives us a menu and the wants to know the appetizer right away.  Um...no, we don't know yet.  We are being what felt like harassed to hurry up and order.  Then when we ordered 1 appetizer and 1 entree he doubted it would be enough to feed us, and warned that the kitchen was closing in 15 min.  

Needless to say, we watched everyone else at the table NOT finish their food.  Like - not finish a ton of food.  We couldn't finish all of ours - splitting 1 appetizer and 1 entree, but we made a much larger dent than the others.  

This place seems like a racket.  They've gotten some positive reviews, and have become ""the place"" to go to in Chinatown.  I wish I hadn't listened to the person who said we should go here.  They do commit to the masses and offer orange chicken, general tso's, and the like.   That should have been a warning.  So if you want really good *Chinese* food that is just a step up than where you get your food in Indiana, Michigan, Iowa, TN, KY, and anywhere else..go here.  If you want something more authentic go somewhere else in Chinatown.  Where most of the signs are in Chinese and you NEED help ordering."
"I work in Chinatown and have eaten at many of the establishments in the area. I tried Joe's based on a recomendation from a Chinatown native who recomended it for soup dumplings. I went around 11:45am, it was basically empty. Even though it was empty, they sat me at a 4 person table with 2 other people.  There were at least 100 other chairs open, but I got over it.  The annoying part though was that I was seated next to a water station and a coat closet as as the employees were moving around that tight area, they kept bumping my elbow, pretty hard, which can be problematic when trying to eat.  Thats my only complaint. Now to the food, I got an order of the crab and pork dumplings. DELICIOUS! I also got an order of chicken fried rice. One of the best fried rices I've ever had. It was an enormous portion, so I ended up taking home more than half of it. I will be repeating again."
"Nice chinese restaurant experience, it's really busy but the food is served quickly and in real good quality. Like the shredded beef and the duck, both tasted great. Really like that don't fry every chinese dish like they do in a lot of places on the old continent. If you don't fill a whole table they seat random people next to you to fill it up. Recommend to go there."
"This place had amazing reviews so I was really excited to try it. We went during dinner rush so we waited about 20-25 minutes outside for a table. When were called in we then realized it was family style downing where we were escorted to a table with 8 other patrons. Being a bit of agoraphobic, I was weary, but boy was I glad we stayed. The food was amazing. I had the Sesame Chicken and my friend had the Kung Pao chicken (which had a little more green bell peppers than expected). The portions were large and white rice was included, which is a good portion also. Make sure to try the house sauce in the little bowl they bring you. It looks like soy sauce, but isn't. Amazing on the white rice and probably on the soup dumplings too. The hot tea was just as good. All in all if you're okay with the elbow room being a little tight then you really should try this place out!"
For me it's like a must-to-visit place. The crab and pork dumplings are awesome. I have been there with a chinese native and I really enjoy the meal and the atmosphere.
This restaurant is a must when in Chinatown.  The food is excellent and the seating is communal which makes it even more interesting.
"We went to this restaurant because our lonely planet guide said it was a good pick. I had never been let down by my lonely planet guide before, but boy did they mess up this time. The restaurant doesnt accept credit cards and I guess the owner is too cheap to bother turning the heat up (it was freezing cold inside). We ordered some dumplings, which were ok, but the entree was uneatable. We ordered the seafood combo and it was a greasy, bland, small, disgusting dish. Oil dripped from it, the shrimp was overcooked and it was just so bland! The staff is also not very friendly. When we got the bill we were shocked, so much for so little! It was revolting. There's also a mandatory gratuity of 10%. The food and the service were terrible, and even though we didn't feel like paying any gratuity, it was mandatory and it's not like they told us that beforehand. I guess it has to be mandatory, otherwise nobody would pay it."
"Was recommended Joe's Shanghai by a colleague who lives in NY, and it was a real find.  It was also one of the few restaurants still open at 9pm!  The dumplings were unbelievable, as was the noodle soup I had to follow.  Bill was surprisingly cheap as well."
"Having travelled to Shanghai and Hong Kong I have high expectations when it comes to Chinese food. This place is truly authentic and the dumplings were incredible as many other reviewers have said! Really impressed with the speed and efficiency of service, it's exactly like being back in the Far East!  Well worth waiting for, even in the pouring rain!"
"Of all the things we did in NYC, this experience was in my top five! They are extremely efficient at getting you in and out, though we never felt rushed. We went around 11:15 and were seated immediately, by the time we left, there was a line out the door...go early! They seat six or seven to a table, whether you know each other or not, I was kind of worried about that, as I am antisocial, but they sat some lovely Asian ladies next to us that didn't even speak English, so it isn't as awkward as one might think. 
Order: BE SURE to get the dumpling soup,I had the pork, comes with 8 dumplings, we split it among my family of three. We also split an order of scallion pancakes (both of these dishes are a MUST). My daughter and I split the scallop and shrimp plate (spectacular). My husband ordered sesame chicken (spectacular). We had way too much food but it was wonderful. 
TIP: Bring cash, not credit card."
"I think people might be being over sensitive on here, I guess I was just in the I'm on holidays it's all good state of mind! The food was fabulous, reasonable and our waiting time wasn't too long. Just to be aware more than likely they will sit you with people who you don't know at a round table that seats 10 but we thought that was part of the fun - albeit slightly awkward. Cheapest place we ate in our whole stay in New York. Waiters are rude (possibly down to the fact that they're extremely busy) and literally throw the drinks and food at you - but the place is packed day and night so they're doing something right! Good value for money, don't take yourself too seriously and you'll enjoy the meal. Felt like an authentic Asian food experience."
"This place was recommended by a couple of New Yorkers we met, whilst away.
Place doesn't look great & not particularly clean!!! However service was quick & food delicious!!
Would def recommend for a quick bite."
"We waited for about 20-30 minutes for 2 people and there is no real system even though they say there is a ticket system. You sit with random people which is kind of fun but the space is cramped. We ordered right away...pork and pork & crab soup dumplings, fried rice and lo mein. The fried rice is the BEST we have ever had. The lo mein was delicious as well. My husband does not like chinese food and ate everything!!! The tea is hot and the service and food is great. Well worth the wait!! The prices are so reasonable for the amount of food. We ordered two orders each of the dumplings because people said we would need two orders but there was no way we could eat all that food so we shared with our table mates."
"Joe's Shanghai's specialty are the Shanghai Soup Dumplings (either with crab/pork or with pure pork filling), and they are absolutely brilliant. Other dishes we had were on the good average side (hot&sour soup, Crispy duck, vegetables, beancurd etc.), so my recommendation is to visit Joe's if you are in for the soup dumplings."
"My girlfriend and I visited on a Saturday night. The wait was about 30 minutes outside on a narrow city street. The restaurant is located in the heart of Chinatown, a good 20-minute walk from the nearest subway station. We were seated at a large table with another family of six, which was fine. The place looked a bit old, needed some renovations, but this is old Chinatown, so we felt like we were visting, well, Shanghai. The dumplings are well worth the visit. The spring rolls weren't great. The chicken chow mein was excellent. We thought the food was excellent overall, and especially the dumplings. This place only takes cash. The server was extremely rude, a grumpy young Chinese man with a New York attitude. Customers deserve to be treated like guests in a home, not like inconveniences. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and will return when in New York again."
"My fiancé and I had lunch here a couple of weeks ago after seeing it in lonely planet. We had to wait at least 20 minutes outside to get in so expectations were even higher. We were sat at a large table with three other groups of diners, which was fine. Service was fast and not great but I hadn't been expecting great so that was also fine. I had beef with broccoli and my partner had tofu with spinach (he is a vegetarian), we both had rice and a beer. It was decent enough I guess but nothing better than the local chinese restaurant back in the UK. Everyone else on here seems to LOVE the dumplings though so maybe this is where we missed out...shame they don't do a veggie dumpling option and we could have shared a portion."
NIce place- good food- can't go wrong eating here.  In the heart of Chinatown and it's always interesting.
"The soup dumplings are to die for but the rest of our food was pedestrian and thrown at us.  Noisey, harassed waiters and none too clean.  But I'd go back just for the dumplings!"
"Have been visiting this location for many years and always enjoy my meal. 
Upfront I admit that I only go to this place to have (several) orders of the Xiao Long Bao (Steamed Buns). There might be other places to get them, but I seem to return to this place on my way through NYC.
I have read some negative reviews and would make sure to mention...
1.Parking in the neighborhood is a pain and can be $$$ if you use a garage.
2.If you visit during peak hours it can be a bit of a wait, although I usually go with 1 or 2 other people which makes things easier.
3. If you do not like the idea of ""shared seating"" this might not be your place. I have visited the Midtown location, which has separate seating.

This is a quirky place that is kind of an institution to some, which makes it kinda busy/hectic at times. (clearly the staff understands this and can be a bit gruff, with no motivation to change). My experience has been that it is an interesting NYC eatery, albeit one of many thousands to chose from. Your mileage may vary"
These are the best dumplings my wife and I have ever had! They're are absolutely delicious! Definitely get both the pork and the crab dumplings! Worth the wait!
"This Joe's at 24 W56th, has few of the problems associated with the Chinatown location, and has excellent food. the Xiao Long Bao ('the soup filled dumplings') are excellent. The dumpling skin is strong enough to not leak and soft enough to melt in the mouth. The excellent meat filling which is often hand chopped to be 'the real deal' in China seems a bit fine here but that is a minor shortcoming. The hot and sour soup is one of the best and the yang zhou ('the egg fried rice') is astonishing delicious, light and not oily. The Do Miao Cai ('stir fried pea shoots') were so clean, tender and fresh they were remarkable even without the expected garlic. Left satiated, not full and very content.  House tea is free. YES! FREE!"
"So - wow. We asked two of our most trusted NYC foodie friends where to go for the best Chinese meal in Chinatown. Both of them, separate of one another, said Joe's. So it was decided. We had to go. I will have to say that going to Joe's is almost as much about the experience as it is the food - and yes, we thought the food was very good.
We went at 6pm on a Saturday Night in October. There was a well organized crowd waiting in the narrow street outside the restaurant. They are very good at crowd control. Almost too good. Don't expect to go for a leisurely dinner.
The first surprise was that there is table sharing. They seat according to party size in relation to  table space availability. So we were called in with 8 other people - all seated at the same table. Second surprise was that no sooner had I sat down, than the waiter was magically RIGHT THERE asking me what I wanted to order. I am NOT exaggerating. I asked for more time, but that didn't seem to go over very well. Oh well......requested a glass of wine and a little more time. The menu was a little overwhelming and the waiter was not very helpful, but did insist that we HAD to get the soup filled dumplings, which were so worth it. As it turned out, because of  lack of menu savvy, we ordered WAY too much food. Some help from the waiter would have been nice, but as the review title says.....it's all about expectation. 
The lights are bright, the waiters hover, and the general energy level is high. All that to say, dinner was eaten quickly, and we were out of there - making room for the other diners waiting in the street. 
Expectation - definitely all about expectation. Next time we will know what to expect, and that will help. The food is really and good and worth another visit. The service is .....um....interesting and most likely NOT what draws the throngs. The experience is really pretty cool - from what I've learned from a friend from China - it's also much closer to what you would experience in China than most American Chinese restaurants."
"We went to this Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, New York, following a huge rating in the guidebook! Big mistake! Staff were rude, food was mediocre, (have had better from our English Chinese takeaway) but after finally ordering our food, after the first waiter walked off while I was in the middle ordering, we drank our very over priced drinks and look around, my eye was initially drawn to the tatty pictures of famous people who had visited, clearly a very long time ago, and then....I noticed the walls, OMG, hate using that, but it's the only way to describe my reaction, the walls were so filthy, you could have scrapped the food off the walls, it turned my stomach, I have never been in such a filthy restaurant, and I have travelled the world!  Especially if you have kids...Do not go here!"
"Unless you can go to Yuyen Garden in Shanghai, this is the place for you.
You are not there for the service, the long wait or the restrooms.  You are there for pork dumplings and many other fantastic dishes (beef & jalapeño noodle soup, fried pork chop on noodle soup).
Don't waste your time on the crab dumplings, get the pork soup dumplings.
Payment - Cash only.
Service - remember the Seinfled episode with the Soup Natzi.  Same deal.  Order, don't make special requests, follow their rules and get great dumplings.  You are not there for the service.
Enjoy the adventure!"
"Right in the centre of the ChinaTown district.  If you are a couple of a group of less than 6 then be prepared to share a table with others, although this adds to the charm.  The dumplings which are filled with crab meat and pork soup are delicious, although I would recommend watching on YouTube how to eat them!"
Went here with a group. We all ordered separate entrees which comes family style for sharing. We were 7 and the table was for 10 so we had 2 small grps seated with us which was fun. Overall a great experience. The food was very good. It is cash only so be prepared.
"There once was a place named Joe’s Shanghai
which I would claim was worth a try
The best egg fried rice
at an unbeatable price!
The best food in chinatown that money can buy

(Ps. the vegetarian soup is not that great though)"
I found Joe's Shanghai with Urban Spoon while we were walking around and it had very positive feedback. We waited for about 30 minutes for a table. The food was excellent! At first I was hesitant about the shared table seating but it turned out to be fun.  It gives you a chance to meet and talk to others about their trip and make friends. A+ experience.
"The wait is too long. The food, you can get it at any shanghi restaurant. The place is packed. You really don't have space to move your elbow or place your purse anywhere. You can't even have more than two dish at your table. Will not be back."
"Outstanding food. Some of the best egg fried rice I have ever tried. Perfect rice texture, perfect proportion of egg and perfect balance of seasoning. You would be surprised how many places get this staple dish wrong. Noodle soups are clean, fresh and tasty with excellent quality ingredients. We had the fried pork dumplings. Very tasty although a little greasy for my taste. Atmosphere is busy, chaotic and fast-paced and the service is super efficient. We will be back many times during our stay in NY I am sure."
"So, my 6 year old took an intro to Chinese class this summer.  She's been enamored with China ever since.

On a sightseeing day on our trip, I mentioned that there was a place in NYC called Chinatown.   

Flash forward past the part where I had to explain that China isn't IN New York, and I found out that she loved steamed dumplings.  Looked Chinese dumplings in Chinatown up on TA and came up with Joe's Shanghai.  

Perfect recommendation.  Go for the soup dumplings, order everything else until you're full, then get another order of the dumplings.  The Broccoli Beef, while pedestrian sounding, was delicious.  As was everything else."
"We were told to go here by our waitress at a rooftop bar uptown. We were four friends and waited about 15 minutes for a table which, as others have said, was a table for 8. The other 4 people were also from UK and US and really friendly. The soup dumplings were extraordinary and we went a bit overboard on them. All the rest of the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was great - especially bearing in mind that it was a Thursday night. Round the corner (on Doyers Street) is Apothéke which is a great cocktail bar with brilliant vibe recognisable only by ""Chemist"" sign and doorman outside! Give it a go."
"You have to be ready to share a big round communal table with strangers. Anyway it's not as weird as it sounds and the service is quite prompt. 
We ordered some radish cake and onion pancakes which were just average. The dish which was really yummy was their xiao long bao. The skin was not too thick and once you bite away a portion of the skin there's plentiful of fragrant soup inside for you to savour. After that the meat that greets you is juicy and flavorful. All in all one of the best xiao long bao dishes I've ever tasted!"
"There are better places for dim sum in the area, went with a party of 4 and we waited a very long time for them to get their order of crab dim sum and our order of pork dim sum came almost right away."
"Joe's is best known for the dumplings but we enjoyed the Chinese meat and noodles dishes as well. Take into account that you will be seated at a table of 8, probably with other guests you don't know... But that's part of the atmosphere. 
Also, be warned the portions are enormous, each dish can easily be enough for 2 adults."
"Lets start with this- the best sesame chicken I have ever had.  We stopped as we were walking through Chinatown and saw that it was busy- a good sign.  You will be seated with strangers.  My wife was a bit put off but got over it.  Prices are ok.  Tea was good.  Service was ok at best.  Accepts only cash.  Place is kind of run down.So, why a four?  Best sesame chicken ever."
"Had a wonderful meal here with my family. Walked through china town on a Monday evening and this was the only restaurant with a line outside, was seated very quick. You share the table with other people, which worked for us. The dumpling soup was the best, would return just for them. They only except cash and check the bill because after we left I was told they added a 17% service charge. They made out good. Would recommend this place."
"Every time we go to New York, we have to stop by at Joe's Shanghai just for their crab and pork dumplings.  This is the only place I know that has plenty of steaming broth inside it's dumplings. Other places we've tried only has a drop of broth inside.  The dumplings come with a vinegar base sauce that you place inside the dumplings. Oh, so good!  There are plenty of other dishes to choose from and they are all very good. But the dumplings are a MUST. The place can get crowded and you can easily share your table with others unless you have a big party. The service is fast and the place is clean."
"After a few months, my friends and family tried to dine here again. We had lunch here and we do not foresee any more time in the future. Nothing to rave about. Rude service from hostess and the waiter. Sharing a table with other strangers is a common practice here. If you like closeness, this would be the place. Just keep your belongings on your lap. The waiter/waiters have no problems ""pushing"" the items onto the floor when he puts your food on the table. Pork soup dumplings are just ok, sesame chicken-half overcooked; chicken or beef or pork lo mein come in small portions. One passing dish-the fried sea bass was tasty and bony. They take cash only. Your bill will include Mandatory 15% gratuity and then tax on top of that for the total amount due. 
Try 456 Restaurant (just three blocks away), better food quality especially the pork soup dumplings 
And the sesame chicken. The waiters are more courteous too."
"We went on a recommendation from a friend who used to live in New York.  The soupy dumpling is what they were famous for and they were very good.  The price is excellent especially for New York.  The tea was good.  They do seat you with strangers on a large table, but better than waiting for hours to be seated.  The service was fast.  Could use more descriptions on the menu."
Recommended this by hotel and was not let down and worth the wait for a table. Prices reasonable but be careful as we orders a main each for 4 persons and the portions were very large and in fact could of shard one between two persons easily.
"FOOD:
The real reason to go.
Soup dumplings:
-the pork ones are out of this world. Put it on your spoon and bite the top off, drink some broth, then gobble the rest. 
Soups:
-the hot and sour is good and should be shared. 
Beef:
Beef w string beans
Chicken
The general or spicy w veggies 
Shrimp:
The plum sauce 
Salt and pepper calamari:
Very good
Crispy duck:
One of our favorites. 

Location:
A bit off the beaten path as it is hidden on Pell Street, but look for the number and you'll be ok."
"China Town doesn't have a whole lot do do in it...except to eat! This is the one and only restaurant in China Town that always has a line out of the door. That means that there is amazing food. They have everything your favorite Chinese restaurant has, but they do it better. Beef and broccoli, lomein, fried rice, egg foo young, etc. They are known for their dumplings...they are amazing (but eat them all first before your meal because as soon as they cool, they are no longer tasty). We also had the moo shoo pork and General Tso Chicken. The portions are family style so come hungry and bring cash (they don't take credit card)."
"My coworker brought me here and this place was awesome. You have to be very open minded because this is a very small place, they hand you a number and then when your number is called they seat you at a table with approximately 8-10 strangers. I personally thought this made it even more of an experience and the food was incredible. I would highly recommend it."
"We were a party of ten.  I had asked to reserve a table @ 5pm on a Monday and was refused.  I was told that they only take reservations for parties of ten people.  When I told them that we did have ten people, I was told that Monday evening was not busy and we could be seated as soon as we got there.  Six of my friends got there @ 5pm and they were refused a table. Ten minutes later, when the rest of us got into the restaurant, we were able to get a table.
There was absolutely no service. We had to repeatedly wave the waiters down to get our drinks and order our food. 
The food was terrible.  We had ordered some classic Shanghai food. All the dishes came to the table with some dark soy sauce color, looked like they were all cooked with the same sauce. My mom is from Shanghai and her food is much better. 
The restaurant was extremely cold, our food got cold very quickly. We had to ask our waiters to give us warm tea to keep us from freezing. Needless to say, few of us ate much.
After a while at the dinner table, the bill came up, they put the service charge on the bill although we never get our water or tea refilled. As soon as we payed the bill, a few of the waiters came over and started cleaning the table despite our protesting that we were not done. We were basically kicked out of the restaurant. 
There are quite a few Shanghai restaurants close by, which provided much better food and service.
I will never go to that restaurant again. If you know Chinese, 店大欺客，which means store abuses customers. I have never been so embarrassed, my friends came all the way from China and Canada, all we wanted was a nice place to eat and talk. That place is not Joe's Shanghai."
"In chinatown, authentic chinese food, just enough choice, tastes healthy, fast service but you probably will have to wait your turn. But is certainly worth it. A bite noisy and don't go for the ""decor"". Just one big room ful of round tables."
"We waited a long time to get a seat in this place. The food is ok.  Nothing special.  They only have chopsticks, no forks.  If you are not comfortable with chopsticks, skip this place.  Our waiter was not helpful and actually seemed mad when we didn't order what he suggested.  He didn't speak English so I have no idea what he was trying to tell me.  The place is loud, you share a table with strangers who will ignore you and not hand you anything and I really did not think it was all that clean.  We had a terrible experience.  Instead of this place, go to one of the countless noodle shops in Chinatown who will give you a fork, point to the menu to make sure you understand and try to be helpful.  Joe's is completely overrated."
Sitting beside the trash cans and dirty things - I lost my appetite at all. I'll never go there again.
"The Xiaolongbao (""Shanghai"" Soup Dumplings) are sublime.  The two options are either Crab Meat with Pork Meat Steamed Bun or Pork Steamed Bun.  The come eight to an order in a bamboo steamer.  The soup is what distinguishes them.  Din Tai Fung's dumplings may have a more delicate skin and better bite and mouth feel, but Joe's soup makes their dumplings more flavorful.  

The Shredded Turnip Shortcakes are well executed, but other than the occasional specials like eel with chives or soft shell crabs, the rest of the menu is pretty pedestrian Chinese-American fare.  Do order the steamed buns, but try and refrain from getting the General Tso's chicken.  They buns don't travel well, so eat up when you're there.

The restaurant itself is a dive, cramped and small, waits are typical - take a number and hope your entire party is present, there are some small tables but expect to be shoehorned into a shared table.  It has become a tourist and foodie destination, replete with a ""Celebrity"" Photo Wall.  Waiters are at best apathetic and worst surly, but are speedy.

Cash only and a 15% gratuity is automatically included.  American tourists in haste will erroneously ""double"" tip which the Waiters will gladly accept."
"Someone from home (Houston) recommended Joe's Shanghai, and am I ever glad I took their recommendation. My college-age son, teenage daughter and I had the best food and best time there one night during our recent NYC trip. The steamed soup dumplings are famous, and for good reason - they are incredible. On the advice of our lovely New Yorker table-mates, we also got the pork fried noodles, and General Tso's chicken. The General Tso's was the best I've ever had, and we didn't even have to request all white meat. Joe's is on a little side street in Chinatown, so you have to look for it, but you can spot it by the crowd waiting outside. The night we were there, it was crowded, loud, and hot, but that just added to the experience. Joe's seats only large round tables, so if you have less than 8 or 9 people, you'll be sharing a table. We sat with a great group of lively young professionals who initiated us in the art of eating those soup dumplings. This is a ""must not miss"" restaurant for everyone visiting, or living in, NYC. Oh, the price is great also - just an added bonus!"
"This place is great, quick, amazing food and GREAT dumplings! A must to order both types! The scallion pancakes are delicious as is the special fried rice, the cold noodles in sesame and the soups! Just outstanding! Waiters sometimes a bit rude but can be accepted due to the amazing food."
"BEST xiao long tang bao (Steamed soup dumpling: $5.95 for 8 pc)
BEST scallion pancake ($2.95)
BEST drunken chicken ($7.95)

No really, it's amazing how a well-renowned Chinese restaurant can serve all these excellent food at cheap prices! The star of course is the XLTB. Be careful when you pick up a dumpling so that you don't break it, because it is filled with hot delicious soup that you do not want to waste! Once you carefully placed it on your spoon, break it so your spoon will be filled with the soup within. 

Don't try to directly bite the XLTB like a normal dumpling! It will be a hot mess.

Be sure to get the golden pan-fried scallion pancake and the drunken chicken too! I haven't had a drunken chicken this good ever since my first drunken chicken dish in a high-end restaurant in Taiwan.

It's cash only and you may have to wait for a while so be prepared. If you are visiting NYC Chinatown, you need to eat a meal here especially if you want stellar XLTB!"
"I have been returning to Joe's Shanghai restaurant every visit to New York since 1998 and recommending to all my friends to visit this place.

You have to wait a long time outside before being seated, the service is ""Chines""' not pleasant, you are seated with other people on the table.

But as soon as you take the first bite of the soup filled dumplings (I prefer the shrimps and pork), you forget there is anyone around you. It is just you and the taste buds.

I also love the jumbo filled shrimps. It goes down well with the Tsing Tao Beer.

Well worht the visit."
"I've been to Din Tai Fung in Taipei 101 and in KL and this is closest rival for xia long bao. I was surprise how good it is, during our short stay we went there twice for dinner once is not enough. On the second day we tried the peking duck and this is also a good place for this authentic chinese dish. My family loves the place and highly recommend to anyone looking for authentic chinese dish. It's a walk from our hotel but it's always worth the effort and the price is reasonable. This was the cheapest restaurant, but the food is great! !  Will visit this place again once in New York."
very busy and popular especially with locals - well known for dumplings or dim sums which seemed very very popular !! noisy atmosphere which we loved - portions sizes really good - green tea on the house - be prepared to share a table mind as seem to sit anyone anywhere if there is a space - worth a visit in Chinatown as nothing like what we get served in Britain - reasonable price per person
best xiao long bao I have ever had. communal seating and long waits are forgotten after a bite into one of their juicy dumplings. I crave this place always.
"Nice place place, but we were a bit disappointed by the food. 

Portions are hearty though, beef not bad, xiao long bao not that good. 

Service was good"
"This place is in a small street in Chinatown. It is always crowded, so you have to wait patiently for an available table, where it would occur that you have to seat with other customers. Not all the dishes are terrific, but the jaozi, the stamed dumplings, are real tasty and well done. The price/quality ratio is good."
"so it gets a ""B"" with the health inspectors but we give it an A for the food.  We waited a half hour to get into this New York classic.  They cram you in and you might share a table but the food is so worth it.  The soup dumpling balls explode with delicious taste in your mouth.  The army of waiters and staff, a sure quick turnaround.  The orange beef was yummy and there was a pretty good variety on the menu.  Just go there, you'll have fun."
"When planning our trip to NYC, we wanted to include dining in Chinatown. In addition to reviews, we had personal recommendations for Joe's Shanghai from a local resident of Chinatown working in our city for the Summer & a client's son who works in nearby FIDI. The steamed buns (soup dumplings) are the draw for tourists, a menu item that's as much a novelty as a ""delicacy."" The other dishes were comparable to those from our hometown Chinese restaurants. Joe's Shanghai is a popular restaurant & they don't take reservations so be prepared for a long wait, especially in the evening, standing on the sidewalk outside. Dining is communal & payment is by cash only."
Soup dumplings were better here than the ones we've had in Shanghai. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is place doesn't look clean. I wouldn't dare venture into bathroom as I would prob never return.
"Joe's Shanghai (9 Pell Street, New York City) is an institution by itself. With that one often shows up with a ritual for its dedication. 

Its steam buns are often even better than one can find in Shanghai now days. Most dishes are much traditional ones of fine quality and good value. But some tiring ones such as ""Kung Bao Chicken"", ""Beef Broccoli"", ""Orange Beef"" etc. found easily in regular establishments are something better to be overlooked.  

My 14 years of of delightful indulgence at this establishment much cultivated my routine there. As always the Steam Buns lead the way, followed by Drunken Chicken, Scallion Pancake, etc. The rest of the affair is more or less dictated by the sentiment of the day. Should Shanghai be the final destination, one could continue on with Seaweed Fish, Seafood Shanghai Rice Cake, Lion Head Meatballs, Trio-Delicacy Casserole, etc.. 

It's very much an international institution as well, where multiple languages and regional dialects could be heard across the tables. It is a normally crowded and noisy environment, particularly with its almost obligated table sharing arrangement, which can also give a refreshing sense of intimacy by sitting among strangers and observing some of the most personal behaviors of others over a shared table. One could easily advance a dialogue with the strangers for whatever subjects that happen to hang in the evening air, delicately pierced with the scent of the steam buns which has just arrived at the table next over.

Don't miss someone extraordinaire who could potentially be sitting nearby. The gentleman working on his 3rd steam bun order, all alone by himself while his Smoked Duck is on the way; the lady sitting with multiple pieces of luggage and anxiously waiting for her steam buns simply because Joe's had to be her first stop from the airport; others simply struggling with juice spill issues with their buns. And one could easily become one of these extraordinaire by one's very own merit, unconsciously. 

It certainly is a place to be enjoyed much more with friends and families. Go beyond what you normally would order in other Chinese restaurants in US. Then it's a place to return."
"We're from Central Europe, visiting NY every year. On our trip now, we went there everyday. This is the best food you will ever eat in your life. Best: Wonton soup, Pork dumplings, Crispy beef and much more. If you don't come to this restaurant you will seriously miss out on New York's biggest treasures."
Stopped in by chance for an early dinner. Great chinese food served family style. Prepare to wait in line during peak times. Small groups will often be seated with others at the larger tables. Cash only.
While in Chinatown we stopped for some highly recommended dumplings and we're not disappointed .. When we first arrived we were apprehensive due to over all appearance but as I said dumplings were excellent
"Their soup dumplings are so good, but the restaurant and the bathrooms are enough to make you cringe.  My sister picked up the cabbage in the bottom of the steam basket to eat and there was a bug - so I can imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I love the food, but where is the health department??!!"
"Joe's Shanghai has been around for quite a few years here in New York and we have eaten here many times. So time to write a review, because this place is definitely worth it! If you've never had them, order the soup buns (that's what they call them). These are dumplings with pork and crab meat and liquid inside. They come steamed in a bamboo basket and you eat them carefully with chop sticks and a spoon. The soup inside is piping hot, so you do not bite into the bun with great gusto. In stead you carefully lay the bun on the spoon (with some green onion and soy sauce) and carefully, without burning your lips, bite a tiny hole in the side of the bun and slurp the liquid out of the bun. Slurping is a must, because that is the way to take in very hot liquid without burning your lips and mouth. Besides this delicacy they also serve delicious Shanghai noodles (with beef) and stir fried pea shoots, and many other delicious dishes. The service is typical for China Town restaurants, but that is OK, because it is what you expect."
"Very good food, seating is European style, you share a table with other people.  Nice if you have good table mates.

Very reasonably priced and fun to atmosphere, but beat for lunch or a mid afternoon snack."
"We had to wait outside in the cold for over 45 minutes, but its was definitely worth it! The best soup dumplings in the world, by far! The restaurant was recommend by a friend of us who lived in NYC and she knew this would be a big treat, and so it was! Another must when visiting NYC."
"My husband craves these dumpling we stopped in for lunch. 

I see why he craves them! So yummy:)

Ordered
Pork filled soup dumplings 
Generals chicken
Beer

I only gave 3 stars because the walls could use a good cleaning."
"The food here is really fantastic. You can't book and usually the wait is about half an hour but it is worth it. You'll probably have to sit at a large table with strangers but that all adds to the experience of this bustling restaurant. 

The food is cooked fresh and really tasty.

Family friendly but cash only though."
"we went for the soup dumplings ,they were absolutely fantastic.
As a matter of fact, all food was very tasty. But the place is crowded and you have to sit at the same table with strangers, the atmosphere is like a canteen. 
And the only toilet they have is very small and dirty, disgusting!
Pay only by cash, they add the service to the note and you have to pay until the last cent, we didn't add some 8 cents and the waiter chased us in the street...."
"Talk about lack of luck. We arrived at 11:30 before the lunch crowd and were seated right away. We were informed that the health inspector was checking out the restaurant so they took our order right away, but said it would be after they left before they could get it to the table.  We saw the health inspectors checking out the dining room as well, and they must have got a clean bill because after a 1/2 hour we were served. By this time the restaurant was quite full. There is some communal seating but some separate seating as well. The decor and atmosphere was just like a thousand other Chinese restaurants I've been in from here to Chicago. Nothing special. Service was ok, nothing special. 

The food was awesome. Wonderful pork fried dumplings, crispy on one side and steamed soft on the other. Very flavorful. The chicken fried rice was way better than anything I've had in a very long time. The beef & broccoli was really good as well, the beef melts in your mouth, however way more broccoli than beef in the dish. The moo shu pork was also very good, although I wasn't crazy about their pancakes, I thought they were a little too thick and took away from the flavor of the pork.  

Bottom line, worth the visit, great place with kids, ample servings, and I would go back when I'm in Chinatown again!"
"After seeing an amazing 30-minute 4th of July fireworks display by the Brooklyn Bridge, my wife and I walked over to Chinatown and had a late night meal at this restaurant.
  
The atmosphere is crazy here, very loud and communal seating.  We knew however the food would be good because of the crowd and it was.  We split an appetizer and order Beef with Broccoli, both were very tasty.  We knew they were known for their Pork Fried Dumplings and were fortunate to have our table mates share some with us, also very tasty.

The waiters do not seem friendly but I think that is just part of the crazy atmosphere.  Also, a 15% gratuity is added to all checks.  They closed their doors at 11pm that Friday evening, and were turning away many customers as we were leaving.  Great food at reasonable prices, can’t go wrong here."
"A short wait at 8:30 pm and once in the service is prompt. Green tea is on the table and water. The soup dumplings were amazing, as was the beef and broccoli, the clams, pork fried rice and General Tso's chicken. The portions were huge! The service is prompt. Prices reasonable!They usher you in and out, but it is a must eat when in NYC!"
"Despite the long lines and the massive tourists turnout, Joe’s remain one of the best Shanghaies restaurant in New York.

The Xia Long Pao are still superb, but the rest of the menu is wonderful. Don’t expect any luxury or even amicable service, but if you don’t mind sharing your table with stranger and long lines, this is the place to go.

Piece of advice, come early or late and you will not wait."
"A couple friends and I went to Joe's Shanghai for dinner on a Saturday night.  We ended up having to wait about an hour to be seated.  Seating is at communal tables (so you will likely end up sitting with strangers unless you have a large group), and the restaurant is crowded, loud, and chaotic.  HOWEVER... the food is absolutely worth it.  The soup pork dumplings were the best I have had.  The entrees we had were also delicious.  In addition to the delicious food, the value is great, with incredibly affordable prices.

Note: this location is cash only"
"Sit down, order your drink fast along with your choice of dumpling appetizer and no oft gets hurt! ;) This restaurant has communal seating at big tables serving up excellent food in a manic noisy dining area where you must shout to be heard. Suck it up, buttercup and enjoy the frantic fun Joe's offers because the dumplings are to die for! 

Tip: Get the dumpling with your soup spoon, nibble a hole the edge of the wonton so the soup drains into your spoon; otherwise you will burn your mouth. 

Great service in the Lee Ho Fook tradition (all business, no schmooze) but my glass never was empty and they were attentive in their own way."
"We arrived at Joe's on a Friday for lunch, around 12:30pm.  We had to wait for a table, they told us 10 minutes, we waited about 20, outside on the sidewalk as there's no room to wait in the restaurant.  There were 6 in our party so we didn't have to share a table.  We had the crab and pork dumplings, very good (super temperature hot, beware! I burned my mouth!), shrimp fried rice, sesame chicken and General Tso's chicken.  Plenty of food for the 6 of us and only $75 including tip, cheap for New York City!  Service was good, not incredibly friendly but fast and our water glasses were never empty.  This was our second visit to Joe's and we'll definitely come back on our next visit to Manhattan!"
"My husband is Taiwanese and makes wonderful dumplings, so we enjoy trying dumplings whenever possible. Joe's Shanghai deserves its high rating for tasty dumplings, especially their signature soup pork dumplings. No reservations, and the Chinatown location can be a bit hard to find, plus it is cash only. Be prepared to wait and be seated at a large table with strangers. This wasn't a problem for us and my Asian NYC friend. There is a large menu, with many appetizer, soup, and entrée choices, with very large portions. Shrimp dumplings and onion pancakes were excellent, and the shrimp noodle dish and lions head meatballs were also delicious. Prices were reasonable. I would consider coming back here and highly recommend it if you are a dumpling lover."
"In the heart of Chinatown, food quality was very good. Service was brusque but efficient. Dim sum is a must-very good. You may share  a table, as we did. Worked out fine, we even shared our dishes with the tablemate."
"We queue up and waited for 45 minutes and still not sure was it worth the wait! This place was the only place which had a queue in the whole of Chinatown! The dumblings was fresh, steamy and juicy, it's a must! The flat noodles was very good as was the steam fish too but what is it with Chinese restaurants and their toilet facilities, it let the whole experience down!!! By the way, you have to share tables too with other people and it's something that I am not very good with! Not sure if I will go back if I was in the area again!"
"They are famous for their shanghai dumplings for a reason.  We were fortunate to have walked in with waiting at the door.  Everything was delicious, dumplings, scallion pancakes, pot stickers...  By the time we finished, there was a long line out the door; this was on a Tuesday night.  This place is popular, highly recommended!"
"I must admit I'm a little addicted to dumplings, so I sought this place out. Ruth Riechl the famed and feared NY Times restaurant critic once described the pork dumplings as the best things in the world. So they were definitely on our order along with some Tsing Tao beer wash them down. The trick to Shanghai dumplings is to poke you chopstick through the top to let the soup inside cool down and then 'slurp and savour' it afterward with chilli oil.
We went on a weekday bang on 12pm so there wasn't too much of a wait. Sharing tables means you can also meet some interesting people. We had 7 dumplings to share for $7.50 which we thought was great value."
My daughter was right when she recommended this restaurant to me and suggested the pork soup dumplings. They were very good and so was the dish of chicken and shrimp in plum sauce. The place was very noisy and crowded and we met some very pleasant people on two occasions who sat at our table. We did not find the servers rude as had been reported and felt only rushed when they immediately removed our plates when we finished the meal. That was understandable later when we noticed a line of about twenty people waiting outside for a table. The owner and his manager were very cordial thanked us for coming and shook my hand before we left. This might have been because we are elderly and that is much respected within the Chinese culture. Most of the customers were young and referred by YELP. We would return in the future.
"Really disappointing meal last night at Joe's. Really rude waiting on staff, our main courses were cold before our noddles arrived and the toilets were filthy. Good atmosphere but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about?!"
"I've visited NY 3 times and I've always returned to this place.
the food is really delicius. I've never eated dumpling like joe's ones. They are not easy to eat but they are exellent.

Really recommended!"
"Chinatown is full of good restaurants but this one was the only one with a line in front of it. We almost moved on but we had heard it was good so we waited and it was well worth the wait. The food was a cut above the typical Chinatown restaurant, and since typical in Chinatown is already quite good that means it was excellent. Try something traditional such as General Tso Chicken or the hot and sour soup, or something unusual such as the salt and pepper soft shell crab. Everything was good. Service and ambience are typical Chinatown, and so are the prices meaning excellent value. Recommended!"
"Some of the best chinese food I have eaten sofar. The place is relatively small and basic in decoration, very busy and loud. There seem many (Chinese) locals to eat here, not just tourists. Good atmosphere. Service is quick. Prices for Manhattan correct, as far as I can judge. Will return."
"Hands down best dumplings I've ever had. I love that fact that you get seated at a large table with other random people too, it makes it feel even more like you are in Asia. We also had broccoli beef, sesame chicken with rice and noodles and everything was great. Service left a little bit to be desired but oh well. We were there for lunch on a saturday and had to wait about 15 min for a table so I imagine it can get busy for dinner, since the place isn't very big."
"Tiny place, very plain,crowded and busy, occasional sightings of various actors that may be in town. If there are only a few in your party expect to be placed at a large table with others. If you are turned off by this don't be, cause these are the best soup dumplings and really reasonably priced! There are eight to a serving so share as an appetizer or have an order for yourself for a meal. They serve Chinese tea as soon as you sit down. There is lots more on the menu, but we filled up on dumplings. A great place for friends of family to snack or dine, tasty and not expensive."
"So, was recommended this in a guide book.

My god this is a Chinese restaurant you MUST visit if in NYC. (Definitely the Chinatown location)

There are some down sides, sitting at tables of other groups or couples was a little awkward and the decor etc was very shabby, the waiters were quite rude and abrupt, BUT....

As soon as you eat their food you don't care, it was delicious, have the Pork Steam Buns, they are AMAZING! (We even had some more after a meal in little Italy on another night)

Go there!"
"Great food at a fair price. Always nice to engage conversation with true new yorkers sitting at the common table. Very nice meal overall - and the dumplings, they DO rock !"
"We just stumbled upon this and didn't realize how lucky we were to just walk in and sit down until after we did a little more research.  Found this spur of the moment on Yelp and I'm glad we did.  We sat a a round table with two other couples.  The other reviews on here are pretty accurate when they mention the annoyed staff.  Everyone working seemed irritated to be there.  That said, still glad we went.  We had pork dumplings and crab dumplings.  We both thought the pork dumplings were much better and would order two batch's of those next time."
"You can tell this place is a popular spot, it was extremely busy but worth the wait! Food was absolutely amazing. Just ignore how annoyed the staff is or it might ruin the visit. If you don't ask for water they don't bring you water & also you sit with strangers so you have to be social."
We stopped in and got an order of the crab meat soup dumplings. They were great. I had never had anything like it before. There was a little bit of a language barrier but we worked through it.
"Popular and crowded Chinese restaurant in middle of New York's Chinatown.  Only waited about 10 minutes for late lunch.  Awkward sitting with others at small table.  The soup dumplings, noodle soup, fried rice and tea were excellent."
"Joe's Shanghai is well known for its amazing soup dumplings, and the crowds waiting on the street for entry to this place is a good indicator of the enduring appeal of this place, with tourists and locals alike braving the New York winds to get their hands on these delicious dumplings. Don't mind the curt lady on the door, once you get past her and get tucked into the food you will know it was all worthwhile. We paid $20 each (without drinks) for more food than we could finish."
"You have GOT to try this place! The dumplings are definitely great, but the chicken fried rice and the general tso's chicken WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD! We will be returning here our next trip to the city for sure!"
"Very good dumplings as all the other reviews suggest. Also got fried pork dumplings and scallion pancakes, all very good. Bill for 2 people was $18 for great food!

They do table sharing so you may be seated at a large round table with others, but it's not a big deal."
"Best soup dumplings out there. I could eat them all day every day.
We sat family style at a table with a Chinese family and basically just ordered whatever they were ordering. A great experience."
"Very authentic Chinese restaurant.  The first thing the waiter said to us was, "" how many orders of dumplings do you want""?  I guess we were screaming tourist and he knew that is what we would order.  It's different to sit at a table with strangers, but that made the experience all that much more fun.  The place is tiny, so they rush to get you in and out quickly.  Cash only."
"We had read a review on Time Out NYC about Joe's world famous soup buns, and decided to try them out to see what the fuss was about. 

We were not disappointed - they were absolutely delicious. 
The décor of the restaurant is quite tatty and run down and the service is super quick, verging on being rushed and you have to share your table with strangers - but don't let this put you off. It all adds to the charm. We had to queue to get in, but it was worth the wait. 

It's an absolute gem of a restaurant, I would highly recommend visiting if you're in China Town."
"We went to Joe's Shanghai for dinner during our NY trip. We had to wait more than 30min to get in. Staff let people in before us although they arrived later... We were seated at a large round table with our people. Free tea being served, very hot. We had soup dumplings (very hot, average in taste) and chicken in plum sauce with rice (I had to ask for the rice because the waiter had forgotten about it) and fried noodles with beef. Food was very hot, okay in taste. Portions are generous. We were disappointed in the dumplings, we've had much better in London Chinatown. Overall not the best dining experience, people seated very stuffed, hot and steamy air, staff not very attentive."
"Great food in a charmless restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Dumplings were amazing, as was some dish I tried that had scallops mixed with some kind of fish all cooked in a mild-spicy sauce. Be prepared to share the table with anonymous people. I would recommend it for having lunch while visiting Chinatown or nearby places. TOP CHOICE."
"If you're looking for some Soup Dumplings, Joe's Shanghai will most likely be the restaurant to pop up at the top of the list. There are 3 locations, and I visited the one in Chinatown. Although they're best know for their Soup Dumplings, there's an extensive menu of dishes to choose from. 

The restaurant is very modest, with a no frills vibe, so don't expect anything swanky here. Yet, you'll find the restaurant always full of every type of person just looking for some good food. The tables are communal, so, be prepared to dine with others and have the opportunity to strike up some fun conversation with some strangers.

"Get the mixed and then go for the salt and spicy pork chop, clams in black bean sauce and Shanghai noodles!  We're going back tomorrow for more!"
"I don't get tired of eating at Joe's Shanghai. The steamed soupy dumplings are their signature dish...we always overeat our share...they are incredibly good. Also try their cold sesame noodles and the green beans with pickle cabbage....outstanding. We also had the sesame chicken and I can tell you that it was crispy and delicious. No credit cards and communal seating adds to the personality of the restaurant. The staff is very professional. If in doubt, trust their recommendation....you will never go wrong."
I went here a few years ago when my son introduced it to me. I have been waiting years to go back and finally made it. It was as good as I remember. The steamed pork buns are out of this world! Think of a wonton with the soup inside it. I went here twice in the last week. I had the General's chicken once and Kung pau chicken the next time. Both were excellent.
"I tried the steam buns, noodle soup, and fried pepper beef. Both the noodle and beef were forgettable but the steam buns were really good. The pork steam buns was hot and full of juicy goodness.  It really reminds me of the ones that I tasted in Shanghai."
"It was about 7pm on Saturday, there was a long line-up inside and outside of the building. We were lucky someone in the line told us that we have to get a ticket for the waiting-list, otherwise we wouldn't have known that.
We waited for about 25 minutes and got in. We had to share a big table with other customers, but the family sitting next to us was nice and friendly, so it was an unexpected pleasant experience.
Like wait staff ask you a drink in other restaurants, in this place, they ask you how many Soup Dumplings you want first. We ordered 2, and later we ordered other stuff. Their signature dish, Dumplings were delicious, but we expected more. Our conclusion was we've had better dumplings, and not really worth the long line-up."
"Came on a Saturday with friends and shared a communal table with 2 other groups.  The soup dumplings are fabulous, but are labeled on the menu as ""steamed buns"", which led to momentary confusion.  Being here on a Saturday meant that Chinatown was packed with shoppers, but we had no wait, fast service and steaming hot food.  The prices are great, and we ordered beef with long beans and shanghai rice (very comfort food).  I would visit again, and would recommend it particularly to solo travelers, as the communal seating helps you make friends quickly."
"Sunday night, freezing temps but thankfully, no snow in NYC.  We meet up with the kids in Chinatown where they are going to introduce us to soup filled dumplings at Joe's Shanghai.  We didn't expect a controlled madhouse.  Large round tables that fill up as soon as you finish your meal.  Waiters rush to clean up your places before you can even squeeze past them.  Despite the frenetic atmosphere one an actually eat in a relatively relaxed way. 

We sat at a table for ten and started off with orders of soup dumplings (pork and pork with crab) and chive omelet.  When biting into the dumpling and getting a mouthful of hot soup a smile would have come to my face if it didn't mean spitting out a mouthful of hot soup.  What a sensual and great cold day present.  The fillings were also very tasty.  The dumplings themselves were a little too doughy and rubbery but served as a great container for the soup and filling.  The omelet was flavorful but clearly fried in LOTS of oil.  I'd skip it next time.

Then we ordered shrimp and scallops in garlic sauce.  Super yum.  Just the right balance of sweet and spicy and thankfully, not swimming in a starchy sauce.  To top things off we had an order of orange beef.  Crunchy coating over very tender beef with a delicate orange glaze.  Another winner.  With the bill we got a couple of refreshing sectioned oranges.  Our tea pot was continually refilled but I never did get the cold water I asked for.

Go for the dumplings and try other dishes.  There are many interesting and weird things on the menu.  On a pleasant evening, be prepared to wait."
"Joe's is always reliable for very good food, especially the wonderful soup dumplings.  The place is somewhat upscale compared to its hole in the wall neighbors.  Worth a try."
"There are two locations. We had both the Chinatown and Manhattan locations. Both are very similar. Service was good. The restaurants were both packed. The tables crammed in together. It seems they goal is to seat you, feed you, and get you out. I was told to try the soup dumplings. They were amazing! Never had anything like it before. Place the dumpling on your spoon, take a bite, and the soup explodes into your mouth. Very very tasty. Tried the scallion pancakes as well. Very good as well. Order the hot tea and share an entree with your significant other. You will thank me."
"Soup dumplings, soup dumplings, soup dumplings! Some of the best things I've ever had. It is what they are known for after all. Their other food is good as well. Prices are decent. If the place isn't crowded than the food comes out pretty fast!"
"We came here for lunch to get the dumplings which were amazing.  When we saw the regular food we ordered a meal to split. We had sesame chicken and it was enough for two people and then some.  It was huge pieces of chicken served with rice.  
It was SO good."
"Eating alone in New York can be challenging. I ate at Joe's for dinner and lunch on a one day business trip to Manhattan. Joe's Shanghai is a friendly place with great food for a pittance, which includes the tip. Cash only. When ordering their dumplings be aware that you are going to get a lot of food. At lunch I shared mine with a random interesting fellow diner. I look forward to going back this time with family to help me eat all the great food."
"I know there are a ton of reviews - you can't beat the flavor of these dumplings. My only addition to what has already been said is that you should get there when the place opens so that you can get a seat without waiting. We went too late the first day and was told there was an hour and a half wait. There is no mention of soup dumplings on the menu - I believe they call them steamed buns. So don't look at the menu just tell the waiter what you want and they will promptly bring out some of the best soup dumplings I have ever had. Keep in mind it's a small place so if you are a party of 2, you will be sitting with strangers but I think that is fun and you can have a great conversation with your tablemates. The dumplings are pretty filling so don't over order on food unless you want left overs. IF you want to make reservations, I believe the mid-town Joe's accepts reservations - so no waiting. We like Chinatown too much to eat in midtown..."
"During our last trip to NYC my husband insisted we eat here but never managed to find time to squeeze it in, this time we wanted to be certain we stopped for dumplings. Having had not so great experiences with St. Louis soup dumplings I was a bit leery of trying them, I often find the purse too doughy and the soup is usually flavorless. These little bundles of deliciousness though, oh my goodness, they were perfect. We arrived on 12/31 around 1pm and were told that the wait was appx 25 minutes - about 30 minutes later we were unceremoniously called to our table. The table had already been prepped with a soy/ginger sauce and a steaming hot pot of tea. We placed our request for two orders of dumplings, one of pork and one shrimp and pork. The dough was perfect - noodly and thin, the broth was thick and unctuous, and the little meatball tucked inside was meaty and flavorful.  We polished off four orders in total as well as an order of Chicken Fried Rice. The staff was polite, courteous and helpful and we enjoyed chatting with fellow diners at our table."
"Situated right in Chinatown, Pell street, this place could be easily missed.  There is certainly nothing flashy about the exterior. In fact there is nothing flashy inside either; it is part canteen and part diner and you must be prepared to share a table.

We went expecting to wait as it was holiday season (Christmas period) but were  seated and given menus (well used) in short order. Jasmine tea on tap but we had two Chinese beers while ordering. Obviously we had dumplings, confusingly sometimes referred to as steamed buns, in soup. We were lucky enough to share a table with a regular who gave us a tip on how to eat the dumplings without getting showered with soup.  The trick is to pierce the dumpling with a chopstick before trying to eat it as this releases excess steam and soup from inside the dumpling.  

The portions are hearty and when I first saw the steamer full of dumplings I really thought I would not finish mine but they are light and delicate and I heartily, hand on stomach, recommend them. Being the wimp that I am I eschewed the fish heads casserole in favour of the Kung Pao chicken and we shared our neighbours stewed mixed vegetables while waiting for our Lion's Head, stewed pork balls. He helped us to clear our dishes also, so it was a good deal all round. 

The location of this Joe's is excellent ( there are two others in NYC) and to first timers to the area I would say go early if you have booked in order to have time to dip in and out of the many shops which seem to be open all the time.  Some of them are full of tat but there are also some very interesting supermarkets and some good shoe shops. The deeper you go into the labyrinthine alleys the further away Manhattan seems. 

Back to Joe's.  the food is the main attraction and is excellent.  It s good dining as opposed to fine dining with efficient and friendly service.  Book if you don't like waiting and wait if you like dumplings!  The only negative (which was also evident in other establishments) was the invitation to pay a 15% service for ""my convenience"" which I thought a little cheeky.  We all know how to tip and tipping in NYC is reaching a ridiculous ceiling.  I did leave a heathy tip as the whole experience was terrific.  If you are in the area do go.  You will not be disappointed."
"Joe's Shanghai (JS) has a number of locations, including three in New York and three in Japan although, curiously, none in China.  The restaurant I visited is located on a narrow side street not far from Canal Street in New York's Chinatown.  

My partner and I had dinner there on an extremely cold evening in January.  We arrived around 5 pm and the place was practically full.  We were immediately handed the menu, served a pot of very hot jasmin tea (quite welcomed on a freezing 9 degree weather) and quickly asked what we wanted to order.  

This is a no-nonsense kind of eatery.  The service is fast and efficient; the clientele a mix of Asian and non-Asian patrons.  We ordered pan fried dumplings, corn and chicken soup, and pork pan fried noodles.  The dumplings were plump and flavorful; the soup was quite good, very tasty and non-starchy; and the noodles prepared crispy, which one then bathes with the underlying sauce to make them soft.  Portions are quite generous, so one order each of soup, dumplings, and noodles was more than enough to satisfy two very hungry guys. Not outstanding food, but plentiful and satisfying.  My impression is that JS may be living off their once well-deserved reputation. 

If this is a no-nonsense kind of place, so is the ambiance: noisy patrons and oldies rock 'n roll kind of music. The decor is dated, needing a refresh, and a 
good scrubbing.  But no complains about the service.  

A word of caution: the restaurant will, ""for the clientele's convenience,"" add a 15% service charge, automatically, to the bill.  Personally, I find that practice distasteful. There were only two of us, after all.  But the dinner set us back about $25, which was reasonable. 

You might get a better meal in Shanghai, but JS in NY's Chinatown was a perfectly acceptable alternative for the budget-conscious on an unusually frigid January evening."
Waited on Christmas night for over an hour for a table for 2. However worth the wait. The soup dumplings are amazing!! And the fried flat noodle is great value for the price.. We went back again a few nights after for more dumplings. (Only waited 30min for a table this time)
"very good dim-sum. the place is like a factory dinning room. you share the table with others . it is fun. go there for the dumplings , with soup or without. it is noisy but pleasant. some of the waiters do not even speak English.i did not taste other food on the menu. i liked it very much. but it is not a place to sit relax and talk- it is eat and go."
Food is okay but if there is a long wait do not bother. If they tell you an hour it will be more like twohours . I wish I were exaggerating but I am not. You also need to realize that you probably will be dining with strangers and rushed out  because of the long lines. I am sure there are better places with less of a wait.
This place has the best dumplings.  We have diner here every time we come to New York.  This time went twice for the dumplings.  The other food on the menu is good also.
"I decided to pay a visit to Joe's Shanghai since I have not gone there for a while. I treated my friends to eat there. First of all, I have no patience waiting and we had to share a table among the four of us. It did not meet my expectation. I've tasted better dumplings for a cheaper price located in Mott St. Shanghai cafe and I don't remember the other restaurant name also located on Mott St and Canal St. Joe's Shanghai has been around longer than the other dumpling restaurant, therefore it is more well known. I prefer the one in Flushing, Queens."
"The rest of the food is good and filling and tasty, but you go to Joe's SPECIFICALLY for soup dumplings. In very large groups (between 16-30), we make our annual visit here after the MS Walk downtown. We always order 8-10 orders of soup dumplings, all the kinds, and whatever else. There is plenty of food in the soup dumpling order for 1-2 people, so do not worry, and they are fast with getting you another order or more if you need.
Atmosphere is crowded and noisy, tables are shared...no matter! A great place to sample a delicacy!"
"Was served a dish containing a medium to large sized cockroach. Was offered more food on the house (no thanks) along with a ridiculous explanation that ""small"" bugs are often found in greens. Cockroaches are not ""wild"" bugs like beetles or grasshoppers which might be found in nature. Watch out for what might be lurking inside your soup dumplings."
"Read about this in our guidebook when we went to NYC and decided to have a punt on it so we ventured into Chinatown. Finally made it to the restaurant and took a look at the outside- we were very apprehensive. The outside looks very shabby and could do with more than a lick of paint so we debated moving on but decided it'd be worth a shot as the reviews were amazing... I am so glad that we went in. 

The dumplings were delicious and the mains that we ordered were out of this world. There were 2 of us so we ordered 2 mains which came with rice, the sauces were very rich and there was plenty of food (maybe a little bit too much as it could definitely have fed three). Service was friendly and there was a warm, buzzing atmosphere. Such great value and an incredible restaurant that we have been recommending to anyone we know that is visiting New York."
"Soup dumpling?  Whats a soup dumpling?  Well, for starts its apparently what everyone goes to Joe's to eat.  It was certainly what I went to Joe's to eat and I was NOT disappointed!  These things were LAVA hot and ridiculously scrumptious.  We had an order of the pork ones which seems to be what most people ordered.  We also had the Orange Beef which was incredible and the Flat Noodle which wasn't anything special.  When, not if, I go back I'll do the dumplings and the Orange Beef perhaps trying the fried rice.  Delicious food and a great price (dumplings 4.95 per order, Orange Beef 14.95, noodles 7.95).  Both my colleague and I split the above (didn't have a fridge in the hotel room for left overs) and it was more then enough!

*We got there around 8 PM on a Thursday and sat immediately.  The place was filling up though around 9 with the line out the door!  As others have said you sit with strangers which was quite fun!

**Why no five stars?  NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED!  Huge pet peeve of mine.  Its 2013 and if you're doing any decent amount of business your costs are minimal for merchant services.  Come ON!"
It's one of the staple places in Chinatown with great food.  The wait can be long so plan your visit accordingly.
Thanks to others for the review.  The dumplings were great and not something I would typically order.  We had an early dinner avoiding any wait.  Great NY experience.
"We went here because of other TripAdvisor reviews. They were right. The soup dumplings are to die for. We went for lunch on a Saturday and had hot and sour soup and soup dumplings. Hot and sour was okay. But the dumplings were awesome! You sit at big round tables with other people, but it's okay, part of the deal."
"With so many reviews, your dining experience suffers little surprise : everything was as described by many other happy reviewers. It may not be the perfect place for a romantic dinner, but our whole family liked it."
"The food here is very good. Quite a bit of choices, it comes really fast to your table (making me wonder how great they manage in the kitchen, giving that the place is full and the number of choices quite big), Price is correct. 

It's not a luxury place; it's a good restaurant for a quick-ish lunch if you are a tourist or between business meetings, so it has to be evaluated as such."
"My tastebuds tell me it is not. Although I am no expert in Xiaolongbao (XLB) but the combination of the wrapping and inside (especially during the hairy crab season when I had the crab roe XLB in Shanghai), it was no comparison.

But for NYC, short of traveling to Shanghai, I think it is worth at least once to trek to Chinatown and give this a try. 

Based on the numerous high ratings on TA as well as the other foodie website, I came to this nondescript place on Pell street on a weekday around 1pm and was whisked right in for a party of 2. 

Of course, one should not expect to have a table all by themselves given the fact there are a lot of patrons both from local and out of town all aiming to have the same famous dishes. Sharing of table is a given (just like many places in HongKong) so the restaurant can pack in as many people as possible. But that is ok, it might even enhance the experience. 

Looking around there are plenty obligatory Celebrities on the Wall photos, the restaurant seats probably close to hundred, all in cramped space. The waiter just assumed everyone came here for their XLB and started the conversation with ""Dumplings""? Indeed most do. 

Ours came in about 10 minutes and it was pretty good, though I wish they put more shredded ginger in my dark vinegar dipping. The wrapping has the proper thickness and chewiness, inside the flavor was not as complex as the ones I had in Shanghai, but it is doable. As for other dishes they were not memorable. 

Overall it was a decent meal, service was efficient to ensure high turnover. The best part is the price, at $5-7 for 8 dumplings it is downright cheap for NY."
"People who live or work in the area know that Joe's has terrific food, so you will need to go off hours to avoid a long wait. We have lunch at Joe's between 11:00 and 11:30 AM. 

Joe's introduced the soup dumpling, filled with either pork or crab, to NYC and there isn't a better tasting dumpling anywhere. There is a technique to eating these dumplings. The dumpling must be placed on a soup spoon, the top opened somewhat to allow steam to escape and the ginger/soy sauce to be dropped in to be mixed with the soup. Wait a moment to allow it to cool. Pierce the dumpling by biting the side of it and sip the wonderful soup through the opening. Then eat the dumpling skin and pork or crab contents. It is wonderful

The last time we brought out-of -towners to Joe's, they commented, ""Ah, so this is what General Tso's chicken is supposed to taste like. We have not had a bad dish at Joe's ever, from the pan-fried noodles with vegetables or shrimp to the shredded pork with dried bean curd. It is all great.

Be prepared to share a table with other diners and the service is hectic. You have to ask for water and rice. But it is all worth it. If you are visiting NYC and going anywhere near Chinatown, be sure to get to Joe's Shanghai."
This restaurant is always packed no mater what day of the week or what time of day.  They have some of the best soup dumping I have ever had.  They are reasonable however they are cash only.
This used to be the best soup dumpling place in NYC but its quality has fallen over the years. My new favorite is Shanghai cafe which is a few blocks away.
"I saw from other reviews that it gets busy and to be there early - got there before 12 and only had to wait for 5 minutes to be seated. The dumplings and crispy beef were delicious! Service was quick and friendly, best lunch I had in New York."
"We were visiting NYC and strolled near Chinatown. We asked a three different people (one Korean, 2 chinese) where we could eat around the area. All 3 pointed us in the direction of Joe´s Shanghai. 

There was a 20 min wait, which we used to get a haircut a a near (chinese) barber. After a little over the 20 mins, we were seated in a table of 5, with another couple we didn´t know. They were regulars and suggested we try the dumplings. We ordered both kinds, as well as the braised duck, string bean szechuan style and sesame chicken. 

The dumpling experience was fun AND delicious, a great excuse to socialize with our table neighbours. The rest of the food was very good as well. Portions typical of most chinese restaurants. The price was very reasonable considering how full we left Joe´s. Service was efficient, fast and friendly. One waiter did not speak or understand much english, yet compensated with lots of smiling.

We will be back on our next visit for sure."
"Steamed dumplings and shredded crispy beef to die for.  Sat at a table with 5 strangers which was quite nice, service was quick and staff were pleasant."
"If you want a great Chinatown experience you have to run, not walk, to Joe's Shanghai!  Fabulous in all ways!!!"
"I love this place. But not sure why! It's old, a bit dirty and not easy to get to but I've been coming for YEARS and just LOVE it! Love the fried rice, the dumplings, everything really. If you don't like to socialize and have to share a table with people, it's not the place for you. But if you want good Chinese food, it's a must try. CASH only!"
"Love this place. Whenever we go to NY we visit Joe's Shanghai in pell st. There is one in Midtown which is good but more expensive and doesn't have the same busy chaotic vibe. The pork soupy dumplings are to die for!! I could eat them all day. We also order the scallion pancake, the sesame chicken and schezuan beef. All delicious. The best thing about it - sooooo cheap!! No wonder people line up to eat here. They have a good thing going on, please don't change a thing! We will definitely be back."
"We made a special trip to Chinatown to see if Joe's Shanghai lived up to the number of good reviews and its rating on this website. We left feeling so disapponted.
The front of house staff were rude, thrust a number in my hand and told us to come back in half an hour. Just as we were leaving, however, we were ushered back to two empty seats on a table of 10 where we were made very welcome by a group of business diners already on it.
The house speciality seems to be the pork and crab dumplings but a request for these without pork was met with total disdain. We chose the steamed sea bass with rice and, what we were led to believe, were steamed mixed vegetables although were given a plate of pak choi. The sea bass was nothing special, had very little fish on it and I doubted that it was particularly fresh. We ended up ordering three bowls of rice just to fill us up - none of which appeared on the bill!
I have had much better Chinese food elsewhere but have rarely had worse and ruder service."
"Visiting NYC we decided to see Chinatown. We stopped in around one for lunch. There was a forty minute wait.  The woman at the door gave us a number which allowed us to wander for a bit. The hyper efficient waiter took some getting used to but the food was good, service quick, and the place relatively clean."
The best chinese food I have had anywhere. We showed up at 4pm on a Saturday and had a 20 min wait. But the wait was so worth it. The pork soup dumplings were outstanding. The sesame chicken was the best I have ever had. Even the spring rolls were superb.  You will probably end up sitting at a larger table with strangers but its a good way to meet folks. Cant say enough good things about this place.
"My husband and I decided to dine here after searching on yelp.  We weren't sorry!  The restaurant was at full house when we arrived however seated us at shared table; we didn't mind.  We ordered one Xiao long bao (dumpling), one noodles dish, and one chong you bing (green onion pancakes).  The chong you bing was too greasy for me.  The dumpling and noodles were pretty darn good.  We shared a table with two other couples and had a great chat with them.  everyone at our table ordered the dumplings; no surprise!  We left content and happy :)"
Went to this restaurant based on Trip Advisor reviews. Had to wait 30 mins for a table and people kept arriving. One of the most enjoyable Chinese meals I have eaten and all six of us left with full stomachs and smiles on our faces. Large portions of delicious food at very very reasonable prices
"you have to wait for it......but sooo worth it and the service is very friendly. we cannot wait to go back, if only we could make them ourselves!"
"We waited for 45 minutes on the street for a table, and then we were seated at the same table with another couple.  It was crowded, noisy, no-frills, with so-so-service.  They also don't take credit cards.  But after having said all that, the food was terrific, and the dumplings were so good I wish I had made them my entire meal.  I'd go again in a heartbeat."
"Very good food,  had the dumplings very  flavorful.  Sat with others as seating was limited.  They only take cash. Lo mein was great."
"This place is awesome. Can take a while to get a table, especially with big groups. But the food is awesome, plentiful, hot and delicious. The cost of the meal was $57 for six of us and we had a ton of food. Just great."
We arrived at 6.45pm to be greeted by what can only be described as a mob of people outside the restaurant. We were the approached by the waitress who told us we'd have a 20 minute wait and handed us a ticket.  This place is deservedly very popular.  We chatted to fellow guests who guided us in our choices from the extensive menu. We managed just 1 level of pork dumplings- so tasty but very filling. Then had snow pea shoots and special fried rice. The whole meal was just so delicious -my mouth is watering thinking about it!!
"The wait is always worth it here!  And do not be intimidated by quick pace of the staff, sitting with people you do not know and not seeing your usual American Chinese food on the menu. Look around and ask what others at your table have ordered. But you must get the soup dumplings!  Google how to eat soup dumplings before you go and maybe you won't burn your tongue!"
Amazing food guaranteed! The down side is that you are seated in the same table with other customers and the waiters are like robots. Great Service is extremely important anywhere you go which they need to understand. All in all the price is very affordable.
"This little place in Chinatown has ruined me for Chinese food anywhere else! A line was formed outside, but the restaurant seems to keep things moving, and we waited only maybe 5 minutes.  The 2 of us were seated with a family of 5 at a large table, which was fun to get to chat with other folks over lunch.  The pork buns are, quite simply, the main attraction.  They come 8 to a steamer basket and are delicious.  We split the pork buns, and an entree of sesame chicken and fried flat noodles.  In fact, we were trying to order 2 plates of food and the waiter told us 1 would be plenty between the 2 of us and boy was he right!  I wont be able to eat Chinese food anywhere else now without comparing it to the food here. Do your self a f(l)avor and hit up Joe's Shanghai when you're in NYC."
"Have to queue for ticket number to get a table. Once in the restaurant is vibrant and busy. Locals eat here and once the food arrived we could see why. Large portions of delicious, very reasonably priced food. Staff very helpful with choosing dishes as so much choice. Would recommend the dumplings. Enjoy!"
"Fabulous china town experience for dumplings and traditional Cantonese Chinese. 

Highly recommend --- even if there is a line around the corner. 
Go Early and Enjoy!"
"I had heard about the (in)famous soup dumplings from a co-worker who was taken here by a Hong Kong resident visiting NY. Actually, that says it all -- Chinese travelers to NY go here. From a lifetime of eating Chinese food in high end restaurants in Manhattan and completely authentic ones in Flushing, categorically this is the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.  The service at the Pell Street location was not the friendly more western style we prefer, but it was efficient and not rude. Being used to first-timers at this Chinatown tourist location, they provided a lesson in how to eat the soup dumpling. Nontheless, the meaty broth splattered on my blouse as I devoured them.  Good pricing and great food result in a high value meal, a critical determinant of a good restaurant.  I plan to go to the Flushing location and bring all my NY visitors until the waiters get to know me and maybe crack a smile.  At Pell Street two of us shared the Shanghai wonton soup, soup dumplings and the shrimp & scallops in garlic sauce. I ate to bursting (too many dumplings in our selections) and would do it again.  A good long walk around Chinatown and street shopping make it a great destination."
"We chose this restaurant because we wanted to eat in Chinatown and because it got one of the best ratings on Trip Advisor.  Apparently, everyone else in NYC felt the same way because this was the only restaurant in the area that had a wait.  It took us about 25 minutes to get a table for 3.  In actuality, it was a table for 9, as everyone shares tables in this restaurant. Our tablemates didn't talk to us much, and that was fine by me.  It gave me time to concentrate on my food. 
My companions and I kept it pretty basic on the ordering:  Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken and Lo Mein.  My Kung Pao chicken was excellent.  My sister's Lo Mein was also tasty.  My friend Julie did not really care for her dish, stating that it was something she could get anywhere.  Upon tasting it, I agree.  However, I was so overjoyed with my dish and my hot and sour soup that I will still give this place a glowing review.  
I was concerned that the restaurant only got a B health score, and normally that would give me pause about eating there.  In fairness however, I did not see a single A in Chinatown.  I am happy to report that nobody got sick from our dining experience, and I would gladly return to this restaurant.  
Service here is fast because they want to turn over the tables.  This is OK, however, because the place is so frenetic that once you finish eating, you don't really want to stay there to socialize.  You just want to go there for the Kung Pao Chicken!"
We went on a Friday and waited @ 30 minutes.  We were a party of 9.  4 adults and 5 kids (4-16).  Everyone loved the food.   The Dumplings were great and the General Tso's Chicken was too.  The place was packed so the chatter of the kids blended in nicely.  They had tons of people on staff so there is alway someone around if you need anything.
"Here at joe's Shanghai I ate the best dumplings of my life. The wait can be long but it's definitely worth it. I havent tried any other items of the menu, but everything looked awesome. Must-go place for dumpling lovers."
"We've been to this place for many years.  Brought our son there a few years ago and he fell in love with their dumplings.  Every time we go to the city, he would ask to go to this restaurant.  They have long lines especially during weekends, but once you sit down and place your order, the dumplings would be on your table in few minutes.  I prefer the traditional pork dumplings rather than the ones with seafood.  Bear in mind that you need to share tables and pay with cash, you simply wouldn't choose to go there for your first date or if you need time to talk about business."
"A friend brought me here for the soup dumplings on my first trip to NYC.  It has become one of my ""go-to's"" each time I am back in the city.  I always bring someone with me who has never experienced soup dumplings and whether a native or someone from out-of-town like myself, they are all converts and it becomes their go-to.  The soup dumplings really are incredible but also try the turnip cakes and green beans.  That is pretty much a shared meal for two or three people (ok, throw in some fried rice) with maybe an extra order or two of soup dumplings.  Did I mention it is really cheap??  Yes, the waits can sometimes be long but they do get the food out fast so people are moving in and out quickly.  I have looked for restaurants with soup dumplings in my foodie city but we have nothing like it.  I get some serious cravings between visits to the city.  Can't wait for my next trip and meal at Joe Shanghai's!"
"Great Chinese specialty restaurant... but time is money too.

Joe's Shanghai does indeed offer some of the best tasting soup dumplings in the area. There is no doubt about it. They have the traditional pork soup dumplings and also the less often seen seafood and pork soup dumplings.

However, the waits are sometimes ridiculous. I mentioned that time is money. But more than that, I really believe that you can get great soup dumplings all over Chinatown. It doesn't necessarily have to be at Joe's Shanghai. If you're not into soup dumplings or not hoping to try them, don't even waste your time. Aside from the soup dumplings, Joe's Shanghai's menu is just okay. You can definitely find those items elsewhere in the vicinity without the wait, and they are probably just as good or better tasting."
"My sister recommended we try this place out on our adventure to New York! She casually said try their super awesome dumplings. Little did my mom and I know what we were getting ourselves into. Along with a large crowd, we waited our turn to try out these dumplings and some noodles. Besides authentic and true Chinese cuisine, you can't go wrong with the food here! At the time we went, they were out of peking duck with buns (my favorite), so we opted for noodles and dumplings. As newbees to the restaurant, we were taught the ""correct"" way to eat the dumplings by one of the servers. Such a fun experience that is perfect for preferably smaller groups, but if you don't mind the wait, then bring in a big crowd of people. We enjoyed the noisy, bustling environment! This is one of those restaurants you have to go to when you're visiting New York, especially if you love Asian cuisine."
"It wasn't crowed when I stop by there for take-out. 
Their Xiao Long Bao is very famous!
It has pork and curb meat in the dumplings.
It was 6 dumplings in one order. So, it is good for share.

I was watching fishes when I was waiting for my order.
They are so beautiful creatures. Their scale, eyes, fins and the way they moved are amazing.
If you are bored to wait for seat or order, please check them out."
"I come here every time I visit NYC and the food is always consistently good. The soup dumplings are a must! Expect to wait 20-30 minutes before getting seated as there is always a line out the door. The service is not fantastic because the restaurant is so crowded and tiny, but the food makes up for it. Seating is family style so you will most likely be sharing a table with strangers."
"Our family was visiting Manhattan & our daughter kept asking for chinese food.  We looked at a lot of reviews & decided this seemed to have the best prices & selection that we would like.  The food was delicious & the cost was very reasonable.  We liked the soup dumplings so much that we placed a second order at the end of our meal to have for dessert! 

The only complaint is that we did end up sitting at a table with 2 other people.  I had read in the reviews that this was a possibility, but had failed to mention it to my family.  We are not used to it, but the 2 women were very nice & it really was not a problem."
"While in NYC, we planned to visit China Town, so we asked a resident friend of ours to recommend a restaurant.  He couldn't say enough good things about the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai's, so we headed over there to give it a try.  

From the outside, Joe's Shanghai is pretty non-descript.  There's no hype or billboards boasting popularity or their specialties.  The inside is kind of a dive, so don't expect anything fancy.  The tables are jammed in so tight that you can't walk between tables, which are right on top of each other.  At some of the larger tables, the patrons .  

From the minute you walk in, the wait staff herds you in like cattle, seats you, and immediately asks for your order.  At times, they shouted questions to us from across the room rather than coming up to our table.  When you're done eating, they also try to rush you out, because they want you to leave and make room for the next customer.  Knowing how highly this restaurant was recommended to us, we determined that this was an integral part of the Joe's Shanghai dining experience.

Of course, we ordered the soup dumplings right away.  We were not disappointed!  They were so fabulous that we quickly devoured them right away.  You have to be careful to open the dumpling slowly in the spoon so you don't burn the inside of your mouth because the soup inside is hot.  One serving was not enough to satisfy 2 adults and a hungry 13-year old girl, so we looked around at the interesting dishes being served around us.  The most interesting (and popular) dish we noticed was the soft shelled crabs.  I personally preferred this more than the soup dumplings!

If we had bigger appetites, we would have tried more dishes, because it was apparent that everything there was good.  We especially wished we had room for the crispy duck, because every table around us seemed to be enjoying it.  By the way, we had a couple of orders of spring rolls, which were good, but nothing unique or special like the others I mentioned.  I'm so glad we were able to give this place a try!"
"On the way to NY at the end of June, a young Marine on the plane told me about Joe's Shanghai as his grandparents lived in the city and it was a place he loved.  My husband and I, along with our 3 kids (11 year old twins and 9 year old) absolutely loved everything that we tried - sesame chicken, duck, the vegetable special and shrimp.  My kids had never had dumplings and they loved the soup dumplings also.

There was a fairly long line (you wait outside and it was a hot day) but the wait was thankfully very quick.  We shared a table which didn't bother us at all.  Note: it is cash only."
"You will have to queue because this place is so popular. Some of the best dumplings I have had in the world and we travel a lot, and so cheap. Love it."
"As a native New Yorker there are not many things I haven't  tried or tasted, but I had never heard of soup dumplings before. People line up in front of this family-style seating dive so we figured it was good. Our friends had been talking about it for years so we had to give it a go. I'm really glad we did. We had the soup dumplings--pork and seafood. Skip the seafood. The pork dumplings are just insane. Everyone in the place seemed to have them at their table. We ordered a variety of other dishes and talked to one of the other parties at the table. It's a great NYC experience. The prices are reasonable and portions are very ample. NO SOUP FOR YOU!  I'm keeping all of it."
"Dumplings widely regarded as the best in New York, but the real surprise was the incredible tasty sesame chicken. Yummy!
You must go here, if you crave for fresh chinese. Waiting time around lunch is approx 1/2 hour."
"Joe's had been one of our favorites in NYC, but on our last visit it just wasn't as good.  The service was rushed, and the food was so so.  Also, in some cases, the menu descriptions don't match what you get.
While people seem to rave about the soup dumplings (which they also list on the menu as ""buns"" - which they surely aren't), we don't get it.  They tasted off, and were more salty than anything else.  While Joe's still has the best scallion pancakes i've ever had, i don't think we'll be going back.  Too many other choices out there."
"Our friend recommended us to visit this place for Xiao Long Bao (XLB) ONLY in New York.  We went there on a Sunday afternoon around 3PM and there was still a little line.  Luckily, we were seated quickly at the community table.  The service was quick and good.  The XLB was good but not good enough to have the ""Wow"" effect mainly because we had the best Xiao Long Bao ( XLB) at Nan Xiang in Shanghai and at Ding Tai Fung in Taipei before ."
"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times.  The dumplings are fabulous.  Make sure you start with them. The specials board is always good, great value, quick service.  You will wait for a table but it is a quick eat and out, not much atmosphere and a bit crammed which all adds to the experience. The best Chinese in NYC :)"
"The food is amazingly good.  It veers into the Chinese-American genre rather than strictly authentic, but that is a plus for many tourists.  It's fun to go there and be seated at a big table with visitors from all over the place.  It is known for the soup dumplings and you have to try them, but the best appetizer is the scallion pancake.  The sesame chicken is yummy as are the various noodle dishes.  It is so inexpensive that you can load up the table with lots of different dishes to try- fun for a group.  You might have to take a number and wait a bit, but it's worth it.  I wish the place could be a bit cleaner, but I guess that adds to the atmosphere!  We go every time we are in NY."
The wait went quickly and the community tables added to the experience. We started our meal with very hot and very tasty special soup dumplings. A must have.  The never empty hot tea was also very good.  My wife had a large dish of shanghai fried flat noodles and I enjoyed my crunchy beef.  Everything was full of flavor and my only regret is that we only dined at Joe's once.  We will visit whenever we get back to NYC
"After the posiive reviews, I planned eating at Joe's Shanghai during my short trip to NYC. I am
of Chinese origin and was really looking forward to great authentic food, but to my disappointment, i found my dishes to be rather mediocre. The Xiao Long Baos (soup dumplings crab and pork) had a too thick skin to it and flavour was alright, and a noodle dish we ordered was really nothing great.  Service was good and efficient - unfortunately for a foodie like me, food here was just disappointingly average."
"I am of Chinese origin, and when I read all the rave reviews, I decided that Joe's Shanghai would be a Must Try while visiting the Big Apple.  Waiters were courteous, service was very efficient, but unfortunately, the two dishes I ordered were disappointingly mediocre: the skin of the Pork and Crab soup dumplings was thick and unrefined, and the filling was alright, but nothing special.  The noodles in the Pan fried Seafood Noodles were freshly prepared which was great, but the ingredients and flavor was just ok, nothing special."
"I first discovered Joe's last year when my friends cousin,a local, recommended it. We were over from London and eat in Chinatown there on a regular bases. So Joe's was familiar to us as a way of eating. We are used to sharing tables and frantic service. It's all part of the experience.
so why is Joe's Shanghai so good.  Well the food for one. We don't have soup dumplings like that at home. We have Dim Sum and various dumplings but not like that. Not dumplings actually filled with soup. I love them!
I brought  my daughter here this year.she's been eating with chopsticks from when she could reach the table and loves Chinese food. So I knew she would appreciate the food and I was right she loved it as well. So next year we will be back again and again.
Not only is the food great to eat but it's plentiful and cheap. A great NewYork experience, just one more thing to add to my list of things that make NYC my favourite city in the world."
"Very good Chinese food in Joe's. Visited this place twice during our 4 nights stay in NYC. At the 1st time we tried theirs best dish ""Dumplings"" - I liked them, but my wife didn't. So we continued with other dishes (shrimps, beef, fried rice).  This venue is very popular so we had to wait 10-20 minutes in a line to get inside. Also, service is a bit pushy since many people want to get inside, but other than that everything is very good there."
"This is where I was introduced to the amazing soup dumpling years ago and it hasn't changed one bit. It blends in with all the other storefronts in Chinatown and has the same unpretentious look and feel I remember. They're famous for their dumplings but their other dishes are really tasty as well. The last time we went, we got an order of the pork dumplings with an order of veggies and it was the perfect afternoon snack for a party of two. There are some nights where it's really packed so plan accordingly!"
"Terrific food and restaurant but... the tables are large so unless you have 10 people you will be sharing.  Not a problem but be prepared.  Service is quick.  Be prepared to read the menu, make a selection, eat and leave.  There are many patrons that they will be waiting for your seat.  Sesame chicken is delicious."
Chinese cuisine as it should be. Fast paced with a funky seating system that is very much part of the experience. Not one to get to over dressed for as the casual atmosphere is what people return to this place for time and time again. The dumplings are popular for a reason...
"This restaraunt was recommended by the staff at front desk at our hotel. Wow. We showed up and saw a crowd of ppl just waiting to get in. We got a table pretty quickly actually. The service, once seated was amazing. Its common table seating, so be prepared to have to share your table with others. The dumplings are the most delicious dumplings I have eaten. We also ordered the Singapore Noodles and crispy Shrimp in meat sauce. I keep licking my lips just thinking about that meal. Before I forget, it practically cost us nothing. Tips are automatically included. I would find it hard to explain not to tip these guys. We ate there every day of trip."
"This restaurant is brilliant. You sit at tables of 8, even if its just the two of you! We sat with a chinese/american family who advised us to get the famous dumplings which were fantastic. I had the deep fried beef and my boyfriend had singapore noodles. Both a million times better than any chinese food I've ever eaten. The atmosphere is great, manic (in a good way) and there were queues outside the door for tables. Fantastic value as well, we paid $35 including tip for the whole meal for two! Go, you will not be dissapointed."
"And what a pity!  Haven't been to Joe's in years and unfortunately not quite the same as it used to be.  Sure, it's worth a trip if not too far out of the way, but bear in mind just not not the divine experience it used to be."
"Place was very busy when we sent there on a Tuesday night.  We had to wait about 30 minutes and share a table with 5 other people (we sat at a table for 10).  Food was excellent.  The place seemed to be full of local New Yorkers, and with good reason."
"The good: their xiaolongbao are pretty good.  This isn't Dintaifung; this isn't authentic Shanghai street stuff.  But it's very very good and well worth it.  Their fried nian-gao (rice cakes) are great.  Chinese greens (dou miao!) are perfectly stir-fried.  It's in Chinatown and I imagine anything you order will be competent at least.

The bad: oh lord, that wait.  We were waiting on the street for over an hour, and it was late afternoon on a Saturday.  Just down the street, you've got 2 other Shanghai restaurants.  Now, I didn't visit those places, but I imagine the food is comparable.  I think this place might suffer from (ironically) ""online foodie review"" glut: foodies catch wind, they come en masse, the wait becomes insane.  Having lived in Shanghai for 7 years, I can tell you that this food is good, but not worth that wait.  Next time I'm in town, I'll try the other Shanghai restos on Pell and see if they offer a better deal, in regards to waiting time.  There's another branch further up town, so you might want to go there instead of wasting your time...

Popularity is a double-edged sword: you know the food is great, but do you really want to wait that long when there's comparable stuff just a few paces away?"
"There's a midtown Joe's and this Chinatown Joe's, and I've eaten at both.  The Chinatown Joe's feels more comfortable, the dumplings are served hotter and are more delicious, and the menu has more budget dishes.  You share a table, and you wait in line for a long time. It's worth it."
"My granddaughter, Niki, included Joe's Shanghai on her NYC bucket list of ""must do's"" & we are so thankful that she did.  Her roommate at the University of Texas is from China.  When her roommate meets her parents in NYC on visits from China, they always dine at Joe's Shanghai and order the dumplings (which are rated #1 in the city).  The dumplings are outstanding as well as the other items on the menu.  Be prepared to wait for a table...it is worth the wait.  Bring cash...credit cards are not accepted.  Really very affordable, quality food."
"Our third time here. No frills, but it's the place to be for dumplings in Chinatown. Scallion pancakes were delicious too. Quick service, decent prices. Looking around at the other tables, each dish looked more delicious than the next!   We got there at 10:45am for the 11:00 opening and were the third party on line. Prepare for a wait, bit it's a worthwhile experience. FYI if you are a small party, you may be seated with other parties at the same table."
"Had a good lunch here with a bunch of friends. Great dumplings, fast service. As friendly as you'd expect at a Chinese restaurant. Decent prices for the food. I know this isn't a foodie dish but thwir general tao's chicken is awesome. Super crispy and super tasty."
"The dumplings are absolutely amazing! The pork and crab particularly. Three of us had two lots of dumplings and a main each, which were not as impressive, the portions are very generous but was way too much food for us. 

Definitely worth a visit for the dumplings alone."
"Incredible food, service, atmosphere, and consistent!  Highest level of quality every time we go.  I was introduced to Joe's Shanghai by a Chinese family with whom we are friends...need I say more?  You won't be disappointed! :)"
"Joe's is famous for its soup dumplings. I'm not sure they're quite as wonderful as they used to be, but they're still worth the visit. The rest of the food is also good. Prices remain very reasonable, and it's fun sharing tables with strangers -- you could get lucky and meet some nice folks (or not)."
"This is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in New York. 
The dumplings are fabulous, the shrimps out of this world.
Don't expect a table for two, you will most likely be sharing a large table in an overcrowded, noisy and steamy environment. A great food experience if you have nothing to say to your neighbor as he or she won't be able to hear you over the noise. 
Prices are unbeatable.
If you prefer a quiet surrounding, the one on W 53rd is definitely better, although substantially pricier,"
"Two words: soup dumplings. Wow! Take my advice and order two lots because one is not enough!

We found the restaurant in our Lonely Planet guide and decided to give it a go. The queue of people outside can look daunting, but it moved quickly enough. The communal eating round large tables might not suit everyone, but it seemed to fit with the buzz and frentic nature of the restaurant itself. Portions are huge, so I would not order too many dishes at once!

Well worth the visit."
"Don't miss it!! very very good!! Try noodles definitely, soup dumplings and spring rolls!! it was full of people, both locals and tourists."
"This place was highly recommended by  our hotel staff, And for good reason. The food was outstanding, and the prices were extremely reasonable. My son or did a bowl of soup turned out to be enough for 3 or 4 people. We had to wait about a half hour, but it was definitely worth the wait. My only criticism is that I felt rushed by the waiters, otherwise overall a great restaurant."
"I've eaten at the Chinatown, Flushing, and Midtown locations.  All 3 have excellent food and service.  Price value is also excellent.  The dumplings are superb as is the duck.  I'm looking forward to going again"
"First the bad news: it's crowded, it's noisy and there's always a wait (no reservations).  But none of those take anything away from how all out fantastic the food is. We've been there a handful of times, a few much loved staples (soup dumplings, pan fried noodles) always on our ordering list ... And we've yet to find any other dishes we haven't loved!  Standouts:  beef with scallion, pork with jalapeño and shredded tofu, mushrooms with bok choy, anything shrimp or scallop.  One of our favorite casual spots in NYC - we even love sharing tables with strangers there, as is commonly the case - and definitely our favorite restaurant in Chinatown.  Highly recommend!"
"One word: amazing. Great dumplings, though it's quite crowded and busy great atmosphere, and the food is really, really good. Would visit this restaurant again!"
"This place is a MUST !!!! Don't get put off by the ""community tables"" , you aren't going to Joe's for a romantic meal in any sense. What you will get though are the best soup dumplings you can find ... well... anywhere. Right in the heart of Chinatown, this place can get incredibly busy, try to avoid the lunch rush. Don't miss the crab dumplings, and all the other types of dumplings as well. Try to stick to just the soup dumplings and maybe an order of special fried rice, there is no need to sample any of the other dishes there, it isn't as if you can't find most of the stuff elsewhere. Those dumpliong though are a specialty, and the best you can find in the city (there are also 2 more locations, in mid town and in flushing; I have only been the one in Chinatown, so I can't comment on the others) The dumpling orders are quite large and filling, and you can walk out of there with a meal for 2 for about $25 (notincluding tip). If you are in Chinatown, I highly recommend this place. Bring your appetite !"
Don't think egg rolls and wonton soup !!! Think Scallion pancakes ....... The food is fresh and very good and its clean ! Which can all be difficult to find in Chinatown ! . No reservations but the turnover is so fast the wait won't be long . They own another restaurant across the street Joes Ginger if time is an issue ! Close to Canal  Street  shopping and not too far from World Trade Center (nice walk)
"Come early before the line gets long. Enjoyed the jelly fish, duck and pork. Good service and great food"
haven't been there awhile till tonight with friends...feel very thirsty few hours later... too much M.S.G.?
The Chinatown Joe's is my favorite for soup dumplings. Either the pork or the pork and crab dumplings melt on your tongue. Try any of the sautéed vegetables on offer on the day of your visit and you won't be disappointed
Ate here for lunch with a friend's recommendation. Food is served quickly and efficiently with generous amounts. We were a large party served family style while sharing a table with other patrons. A lot of locals at this place. The soup dumplings were tricky to eat but tasty. We shared a variety of dishes and all were devoured. Would go again when in Chinatown.
"The soup dumplings there are so good, you could just go and order a bunch of those and be happy. They do serve a lot of other food, but I recommend just getting as many soup dumplings as possible. Everyone who I've been to this restaurant with loved them too."
"A friend of mine recommended me this chinese place, I googled a little bit and everyone was raving about the soup dumplings, so I took the subway to Chinatown to try the famous dumplings...

One word to describe the restaurant: GREASY
The soup dumplings were so greasy it was awful, I felt oil everywhere, maybe I am not that fond of Chinese food but it is not my type of food. I also ordered a braised seabass and again, it was as greasy as it could have been, the flavors were good but I am not going to come back. I can only recommend this if you're craving chinese food.

The service typical chinese, horrible, tourists in and out as fast as possible, not so clean, no credit card, at least it was not that expensive."
"Be prepared to sit with whoever - which is fun!  Family style seating with other diners.  We ate with people from Italy, Turkey, England, Detroit, Southern CA, and NYC!  Fun place, fast service too!"
"We had the dumplings, apparently they assume you want them when you sit down.  We pickedsome safe favorites to share, chicke fried rice, beef and broccholi, and General Tso's chicken.  We ate every last bite of it."
We love going here for the pork and crab soup dumplings. The crab taste is not an afterthought like as some places. It is just the perfect balance of pork and crab where both shine. The soup dumplings are amazing but also other dishes like twice cooked pork and scallion pancakes are done well there. Don't be scared off by the communal seating as most of the best Chinese restaurants seat people together at one large table. This way you can see what else is ordered and decide if it looks good enough to order too.
Ever had a soup dumpling? If not you are missing out on areal treat.  I have great affection for any type of Chinese food...my son-in-law just introduced us to the soup dumpling. Great tasting and eating them correctly without wasting any af the fabulous soup takes some skill - worth the work. This location midtown NYC more upscale then Chinatown location. Come from the west coast so we'll have to track them down back home...may have to hit San Francisco's Chinatown for the caliber of soup dumplings we got at Joe's said to be the BEST in the city....
"We have been here several times and never been disappointed. The green beans are a must , but skip the spring rolls. Go for their specialties and you'll become a repeat customer!"
"This place is tucked away in an alley way.  Always a line to get in.  You share a table with strangers, but it's a great way to meet new people.  Absolutely have to order the soup dumplings.  Rice cakes with minced meat is delicious.  We always go for the dumplings, so we order 3-4 orders.  Everything is delicious - definitely worth the wait. Very reasonably prices,  8 dumplings for around $6. We normally eat way too much, so many wonderful dishes to choose from

The one in Times Square is more expensive and less food, so I wouldn't recommend it."
"Best Chinese food, no reservations, no credit cards, shared tables, there might be a long line to get in but believe me the food is worth the wait. Each time we went to Joe’s Shanghai our must have dishes are:, soup dumplings (pork & shrimp mix) so yummy, turnip shortcakes (flaky), flat Shanghai noodles (with beef), salt and pepper shell on prawns (must order shell on), and string beans so delicious. If you like spice try the red jar on the table, we almost finish the whole thing every time :)
I literaly crave for this food and have been going to this restaurant more than 16 years and the quality of food is always the same. What else I can say…if you eat at Joe’s Shanghai once you will be addicted to it. :))"
"Dumplings and food was good.  The problem with this place is that they always rush you in and out as fast as possible.  Very crowded because it is a known tourist spot.  No big deal.  I already know that.  My complaint was, watching other people sit next to you on a shared table, one lady scooped out the hot sauce and placed the spoon from the hot sauce on her plate and also, licked the entire spoon which that spoon is used for the hot sauce(no manners).  Second issus, another couple then took the hot sauce container, didn't see the spoon because the rude lady placed it on her dish.  The couple decided to use there used chopsticks to scoop out some hot sauce.  Remember this hot sauce is a communal hot sauce used by all sitting at that table.  Then finally, when the lady finished her meal, she took the spoon and placed it back into the hot sauce container.  Totally disgusting.  I understand if she made a mistake and used the hot sauce spoon in the beginning, she should have left it on her plate.  No problem.  When the waiter came, we told the waiter what occurred with the hot sauce and spoon.  He said okay, MAJOR ISSUE, we watched him and all he did was, Add more hot sauce into same container and did not change the spoon or throw out the rest of the hot sauce since it has been contaminated from the lady and the couple that used their chopsticks to scoop out hot sauce.  Anyways enjoy this tourist trap, but be weary on the HOT SAUCE."
You know when people are waiting outside in a freezing wind for a table that the place is good. The dumplings are amazing and our other dishes were excellent. This place is not fancy - and expect to eat elbow to elbow with other diners. Also CASH ONLY.
"Our hotel Concierge recommended Joe's Shanghai for our party of six. There was a crowd at the entrance when we showed up, while there was none at the adjacent Chinese restaurants, so that was a good sign. We signed in, and after a 20 minute wait we were seated at a table of nine, along with a party of three. Although we weren't expecting this, we found it fun. Promptly we were served drinks and pork Dumplings which is their signature appetizer. We followed with soups and entrees of beef and fish. The service was quick, the food was average Chinese, nothing to boast about. The place is noisy, with crowded seating. Overall we had a good time, and it was a good value."
"I have been making it a point to go to this restaurant every trip I make to NYC. Their specialty,
dumplings, pork or crab, or a combination served in a steaming hot, delicious broth filled dumpling, be careful not to pierce the dough when transfering it to your plate with the chopsticks!

Yes, I have tasted many of their other dishes as well, but, I go there for their dumplings. Crowded, you never know who, where or when you will be seated! Trust me, it is well worth the wait. I have just returned from NYC and also had a parade, joyful music with my wonderful food,
go off hours you will not regret it."
I read good reviews about this restaurant so i tried the food was great but eating on the sharing table not comfortable for me. The service was fine though we had to wait to have seats.  The tables are big mostly for 8 people so we need to eat with other people and listen also to their conversation on the table. Over all good food but they can do better with the ambiance of the restaurant.
"Joe's Shanghai gets good reviews in Zagat's and among many non-Chinese diners.  But don't believe it. I have dined there with Chinese friends from Shanghai on 3 different occasions recently.  Their so-called specialty soup dumplings were greasy and the meat and crab fillings of very poor quality.  And the rest of the menu was atrocious. Over-cooked, too soft noodles with no taste, broths loaded with MSG and fish that was not even close to being market fresh.  It is simply not worth the effort. Clearly they are resting on Zagat's having no clue about regional Chinese cuisine and some unexplained and undeserved reputation among visitor guides as being the ""real deal.""
It isn't."
"Having had Chinese all around the world I have to say that this one is in my top list. Great tasting, quickly served and hot food. Service could be friendlier but they just try to serve as many as possible people per hour. The chives pancake was simple and nothing specials. Dumpling were top and the vegetables too!"
"Great food, but very crowded. The authentic Chinatown experience! If you are not sure what to order, look at what other people are ordering.  Most will let you know a little about what they are eating.  The staff is also helpful.  Be adventurous and stay away from the typical Ameican Chinese food."
"I agree with other review about this place... It doesn't  feel clean, you have to wait a long time for a table, the service is efficient (but they usually ignore you), the ambiance is like a noisy bus station (if you come to talk to some friends, don't go there), the decor is like an old dining room (not the place to pop the question - if you want to hear a Yes), the Soup Dumplings were superb, all the other food we ordered was good (but nothing to write home about)...
All in all if you are in the neighborhood thats a good place to eat, like every other restaurant in China town - don't come especially to eat there..."
"I love this place.  We have eaten here so many times.  Yes, it is a tourist spot, but it is also a local favorite.  People come from all over NYC, the Northeast, Europe, and Asia.   You are seated at large round tables with other people.   This eating with strangers is almost always a lot of fun and adds to the experience of eating here.  However, do not come here for a romantic experience.
It is loud, cramped, dingy, a bit rushed, etc.  
The food is great.   And inexpensive!   Tip is INCLUDED!!  
The pork soup dumplings are wonderful.  Put in spoon,  sprinkle with fresh ginger and vinegar soy, then gently nibble on wrapper and slurp the soup.  Yumyumyumyum.  Then you may eat your dumpling.  Watch out for spurting soup dumplings.  Dress accordingly.
I do not like the crab soup  dumplings, just the pork.
All the vegetable dishes are great, especially the seasonal greens, the eggplant, the string beans.
The scallion pancake, turnip cake are not to be missed.
Young chow fried rice, if you are a fan or want take out.
Crispy chicken. A special.
I could go on and on.  Just go, get started. It's hard to get beyond SOUP DUMPLINGS.
Enjoy.
Oh, it is not very clean, but we have never been sick in several years.  But DO NOT HAVE THE SOUP, REALLY.
They only take CASH.  NO CREDIT CARDS HERE.
And I am sure you do not want to wash dishes here."
"OK, so if you want to wait to get in for the soup dumplings, I understand - they're fantastic.  I love them too.
But if I were to return to Joe's, that's all I would order.  Outside of the novelty of these delicious, messy dumplings, filled inside with tasty broth, the food at Joe's is good, but not great.  Bring me more soup dumplings!
Don't get me wrong - I could eat these soup dumplings all the time and enjoy them, but we ordered half a dozen other items and none stood out as exceptional.  They were all pretty average.  Overall, I've had far better Chinese food, but again - I've never found anyone else doing soup dumplings.
Did I mention the fact that you should order the soup dumplings?
The wait staff was very friendly and helpful on our visit, and here's a cold weather tip for those willing to wait for those steamy bundles of deliciousness - you can usually find room up the stairwell in the building where the restaurant is on the first floor where you can wait.  That'll help keep you from freezing to death during winter months if you absolutely must have your soup dumplings.
My impression of Joe's is that it is heavily hit by tourists, and that if you are adventurous enough, you could probably find much better Chinese food in New York - and even better dumplings - right in that neighborhood, even if they aren't filled with that yummy soup."
"My companions and I waited in line for a table for over an hour. This place does not like parties of three. I did not appreciate being squeezed in at a communal table and I did not like the crowded busy-ness of the place and the idea of their rushing people in and out. They do not accept credit cards but we were prepared for that. The staff was efficient, I will say that for them. Better dumplings can be had at Mother Dumpling in Toronto. Clearly, this restaurant was not my cup of tea."
We always make a stop at Joe's everything we go to NYC. The soup dumplings are amazing! The subgum noodles are a must! Can't wait to dine here again!!
"Joe's Shanghai is BUSY! You'll most likely be seated at a communal table, the staff are rushing around & the restaurant is packed full of people. But when it comes down to it, the food is absolutely delicious & totally worth it.  The dumplings are spot on, soupy and golden. We also had salt and pepper squid and Chinese broccoli and none disappointed.

Joe's is worth the hustle and bustle- try and go at a non peak time and avoid some of the rush but definitely go! Totally worth it."
"We stayed in Chinatown and decided to go to this famous place as it was just around the corner.  Waited in line for over 40 mins, people were queuing outside, though it was snowing heavily. Trust me it was worth the wait. We are not type of couple who like waiting in queues, especially when not knowing what to expect from the food, never been to that place before. We are also not used to be seated with 6 other strangers at the same table, but all this did not matter once the food come in. food is amazing, really worth the wait. Sure have to agree that services almost none existent, but then again, its not the pace where you would go for romantic dinner. It’s the pace of delicious food!"
"Pictured are soup dumplings, the specialty for which Joe's Shanghai is famous -- the soup is INSIDE the dumpling.  Ya' gotta have these, but there's lots of other delicious stuff too.  Be prepared to share a table with strangers; it's part of the experience and fun."
"We were in Joe's last November 2012.

The food is really tasty and I would say it is a good Chinese restaurant at a reasonable price...

But the service is really unfriendly our waitress with eyes problem was really not well tempered.

It was as if we were disturbing them whereas it was regular lunch time.

Price is also quite reasonable!

Maybe if you ask another waitress your lunch will be pleasant.."
"Local's don't eat here, neither should you.  Walk around the neighborhood a bit and pick a more authentic restaurant."
"Went to Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown for lunch. 5 minute wait for table.
Big bowl of hot & sour soup for two, then crab and pork soup dumplings, then shanghai style fried noodles with chicken.
Everything was excellent. Service was fast and friendly. Best soup dumplings ever.
Typical Chinatown restaurant atmosphere. But I came here for the food! And wasn't disappointed."
"We ordered a few dishes, wanting to try authentic chinese food, but were disappointed.  You should only try the steamed dumplings."
"A friend recommended Joe's Shanghai to me during my first visit to New York and so off we went to Pell Street. I was a little put off when I entered the restaurant as it was noisy and a bit crowded. But it was lunchtime on a weekday, so I thought that food here must be good. My friends and I were ushered to a big table by an attentive waiter and, in no time, ordered our choices. I didn't really get to sample many dishes but found what we ordered -eggplant with garlic sauce, dumplings, flat noodles, chicken and fried rice  - delicious! The portions were big enough for sharing so the meal didn't cost much.

I somehow found the set-up  (table sharing) different since most Chinese restaurants in the Philippines have tables for small groups and for big groups. We were three when we had lunch and we shared a big table with an old couple and a small family. Certainly, it wasn't conducive for conversation and we just concentrated on eating!

If I find myself in NYC again, I'd definitely eat here with my family and try the other dishes everybody is raving about!"
One of my favourite places for dumplings in NYC.  Other dishes are decent too.  Fast and efficient service.
"We ate here yesterday. The line was long but moved fast. Its cash only, so be ready. The food is good and inexpensive. We tried the crab buns and each got a noodle soup--I had the shredded pork and my husband had the Shanghai Beef. The soups are a meal in themselves. We sat at a community table and everyone's dishes looked great."
"Excellent dumplings!  All other dishes I ate were AMAZING too!  I've had the prawns, the fried noodles, and general tso's chicken.  Its a must!"
"This is a cash only place so stop by the ATM before coming to Joe's.  We got there at 7:00pm on a Thursday night and were seated right away.  The servers are quick and attentive, but this is a busy and loud restaurant.  It's great for food, but it's not where you go to have a nice long dinner.  We ordered two servings of Xiao Long Bao, Steamed Snow Pea tops, Crispy Beef, and Sesame Chicken.  I know, we weren't very adventurous...but it was all very tasty.  The meal, which fed three people, came out to a grand total of $78 and we still had at least 3 servings left over.  We walked out of the restaurant at around 8:00pm.  By this point, there were roughly 20 people waiting outside in a long line, waiting for some delicious Chinese food.  The prices here are great and the food is fresh and flavorful.  Two thumbs up for Joe's Shanghai."
"Honestly, by the time we got to Joe's we were pretty full (my girlfriend and I spent about as much time eating food while visiting as we did anything else), but I love dumplings, and this place was packed so we thought it would be worth a stomach ache (good ratings here and a mention in the LonelyPlanet guide can't hurt a place's ability to draw a crowd).

I won't comment on any of their dishes, or give it a full rating based solely on the dumplings...but they really are great. The pricing was decent, and the service was quick and efficient. The communal tables for small parties add to the fun if you are from someplace where they aren't typically used. I'd definitely go back again, but I might still only eat the dumplings."
"I have been known to just visit NYC's Chinatown from South Jersey just to eat here. The ""Crabmeat/Pork Dumplings"" are to die for. The rest of the menu is stellar. I have been a patron for 20 plus years. A few tips: cash only, long lines move quickly, share a table 'get over it', and have the address...the street is only one block long.  You will become a dumpling addict."
"I recently ate dinner in Joe's Shanghai with 6 friends ( previously there November 2009). On way to Pell St we noticed many of the restaurants in Chinatown and Little Italy were empty. This was not the case in Joe's. it was full with a queue outside. We waited 15 minutes and were seated with a family at a big round table.( Some people may not like this but we felt it added to the occasion as we chatted about the various dishes.) we selected a wide variety of dishes- Dumplings ( pork & Crab), Beef strips,Chicken stir fry, Prawns, noodles. All very fresh and tasty. Due to the number waiting to be seated we were presented with our bill very quickly- no time to digest the delicious food and no dessert ( probably best to eat desert in Little Italy anyway!). 
The only fault I have with this restaurant is the poor hygiene of the toilets. They are cramped and dirty and may be part of the reason why it does not have an A rating. Would I go back?- definitely!"
"Highly regarded and always crowded, Joe's is a fun place to visit. The food is typical Chinese, I loved the Sesame Chicken. They are famous for their steamed dumplings, crab or pork.  I'm not very adventurous when it comes to Chinese food but taste of the crab dumplings was better than the appearance. We would probably order the pork next time. 
   The restaurant has home small tables and some larger and they will seat you family style if there is no exact seat match for your party. Not a big deal since most of the patrons are Asian you can get an idea of what is good on the menu. 
     It's a fun place in Chinatown to bring NYC first timers.  PS don't confuse it with Joe's Ginger."
"The place is generally bustling, you may even have to sit with another party.  It is usually busy but it is worth the wait.  Portions are big, so don't over order.  Select your dish and compare it to your favorite restaurant at home, you will be pleasantly surprised.  We have been there many times, and have never been disappointed.  Don't let the recent ""C"" rating by the health department scare you away.  It varies but the cuisine is always excellent."
"Being Cantonese, Shanghainese cuisine was not common in our home but as our preferences widened, I tasted my first Shanghai-style soup-dumpling at this restaurant and what an experience THAT was!  Been coming here for years and hope to never stop."
I don't get what people like so much about this place. Is it the English name? Pretty much any other busy Chinese restaurant in the area is just as good or better.
"I have been there several times and like to take people from out of town.  The other dishes have been good, not great -- typical of moderately priced NYC Chinese restaurants. But the soup dumplings are USUALLY exceptional, leaving you craving them for days.  Dumplings at the other location in the West 50s and other restaurants just don't measure up.  However, once or twice, I have had an order of dumplings that were not as juicy but were sticky and broke or leaked.  I am not sure why but possibly they were sitting in the kitchen a few minutes too long.  If that happens, try sending the dish back and getting fresh.  Go for lunch or early in the evening when there are no lines.  Service is fast but not hovering.  Waiters may be quick but they are generally competent and not rude.  I think it is Cash only."
"Service was TERRIBLE!  Rude waiters and long waiting lines. Restaurant owners totally did not care about their customers. Not to mention the food! Terribly salty with every dish. And the dim sums, like the crab meat stuffing dumplings.....tasted very average to me. Believe me, I know my Chinese food. This place has very mediocre dim sum dishes and TERRIBLE lunch/dinner entrees! Prices are NOT cheap at all. What is the big deal about this place that they are getting such a high recognition from NYC???"
Terrific soup dumplings. Also like their seasonal veggie options - always fresh and fast. Moo Shu pork and pancakes are also good here.
"It might have been a poor selection choice on my part, but the shrimp in white sauce was just inedibly gross. Sauteed shrimp buried under liquified mayonnaise was nauseating & I sent it back after one taste. In fact, I can still smell it's foulness. The other dishes that my party ordered were just so-so. Definitely skip over this place, as there are many choices in the neighborhood."
Best dumplings anywhere.  The other food is wonderful and cheep. Be prepared to sit with others at a table but not really a problem
"We went here on a Tuesday night because we were craving Chinese food.

Service was mediocre, even for a Chinese restaurant (which we eat at frequently). I had to struggle somewhat to get the attention of the servers several times.

We ordered pork soup dumplings, which were a bit flat in shape. One of them leaked soup. They tasted good, however.

We also ordered stir-fried pea sprouts, which were delicious. Finally, we ordered chestnut chicken, which was bathed in a thick, delicious sauce. The presentation was lacking, however; it was just brown!

Great job: Food is tasty
Needs work: Dumplings were a little flat, service could use a little work

Still worth a visit for Shanghainese cuisine!"
This place had the most extraordinary food that I have ever tasted. The servers were friendly and the atmosphere was great! Soup dumplings were amazing! Don't know why it had a C rating on the door...I rated it an A!
"Very busy and the food was ok, not that great for the prices, I was somewhat disappointed in the dumplings that everybody says are so great, I didnt find them that good"
"Soup dumplings amazing -- you must eat them.   No idea what the rest of the food on the menu is like, and frankly don't care.  Just order more soup dumplings.  Service and atmosphere fine, whatever. Eat the soup dumplings. Great bargain too."
"Call us lucky I guess, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated for lunch. A family member recommended this place for the soup dumplings, and having never tried anything like that before, I was immediately hooked. 

We also tried an order of Shanghai fried rice and scallion pancakes. The rice was simple and flavorful, not quite as brown as some other fried rice we've had, but a surprising amount of flavor. The scallion pancakes were slightly greasy, but extra crispy and delicious. Throw in some chili and soy based sauces for dipping, and its a nice take on some Staple dishes.

Portions were plenty for the two of us, and the total bill was less than $20 - not too shabby. Be prepared for communal seating, but if that doesn't scare you, it's definitely worth checking out."
"There was a cigarette butt in my Chinese broccoli take away! Bleh! Too bad. It was always great food, but that is the end of that."
"Food is good, prices are low. It's not gourmet, and the food is not fantastic but it is fine for  lunch."
"I live in NYC and have been here couple of times. Honestly, this is just a ok place. The food is ok and the service is below poor. We came here last year during a hot day and the AC was off. We asked the waiter to turn it on and we're told that the owner won't allow them to. WTH...are you serious? Also, they rush people out so that they can seat new customer. That's the kind of service you can expect from here.

Btw, there is no better way to cheat on uncle sam for the businesses around here, so, be sure to bring cash as like this venue most shop and restaurants in Chinatown won't accept Credit Card.

This place has done one thing right...MARKETING THEIR PRODUCT. Hence, all the hype. If you never had Soup Dumpling and this is the closest to Shanghai you can get to than give this place a try. Just keep your expectation low."
"My son and I came here for the dumplings and were not disappointed. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad. The place is very unique and a little bit crazy. You are seated at a table with strangers, but that is ok. We had a good time with the people who were at our table. I think some of them were surprised when we talked to them! But this was our first visit and they all looked like they knew what they were doing. So I say dive into the local culture.
We only had the dumplings and I thought they were very good. Found out from a cabby later that Tasty Dumpling is better and cheaper, so that is where we will go next time.
But I am glad we found this place and experienced something different."
The food is excellent and prices reasonable for Manhattan.  The restaurant is a little hard to find because Pell Street is such a short street.  Take some time and visit the shops in the locality.
"The rave reviews brought us here.  The line, the horrible service, and the inconsistency of the food will keep us away for life.  We waited for around 45 minutes and finally got inside where we were seated with a group of obnoxious young people; which is a serious problem when a 30 and 27 year old make this statement.  The waiter was impatient and rude.  The food was crammed around the table and most people at the table did not get the proper order.  The soup dumplings were good, but the quality within one batch was inconsistent.  The entree was no better than any that I have gotten from any other Chinese restaurant, but at a much higher price.  Overall, this was not worth the wait or the money!  So many better choices in the area."
"I have to say I didn't love this place. There was a line, as I suspected there would be, so we got food to go. We had the crab and pork boiled  dumplings, but not the ones in broth. I liked the spring rolls much better. Wish we would've tried the ones they are known for, but oh, well. It was an experience anyway!"
"The soup dumplings have been enticing me to this restaurant every time I go to Chinatown recently. I haven't found any restaurant worldwide having equally tasty soup dumplings yet.

as much as the soup dumplings make waves, I was appalled to find out yesterday the sanitation grade posted on its door is C before I went for lunch. I hesitated, thought about the soup dumplings and went in. But after I had the soup dumplings sitting 3 feet away from the garbage can, I decided I am not going back. 

I can tolerate B, but C must indicate significant subpar sanitation standard.

The restaurant got to take cleanness seriously."
"As expected, food is very good. But I must stop going there. Why, a low rating C rating from the Health Dept !! Dirty glasses brought to table. Rest room needs a clean up makeover. That's just what is visible. The owners are sitting on their reputation. Once people try somewhere else nearby (more than one good, clean choice) maybe the management will wake up and smell the disinfectant"
"We waited about 45 minutes before we got a table.  We wanted to try this soup dumpling that our friends have been raving about, especially at Joe's Shanghai.  It didn't impress us.  We ordered pork and crab soup dumpling to try.  Be careful, the soup dumpling is hot, especially the broth on the inside.  The skin was moist and tasted pretty good, however the pork and crab filling was ok.  The fillings had an after taste which we didn't care for much.  We decided to try other stuff on the menu - cold cuts combo (vinegar cabbage, smoked fish, wine chicken), watercress garlic and sizzling sesame beef in hot sauce.  These were actually better than the dumplings.  Overall, the wait time outweighed the quality of the food.  The servers were very accommodating and fast but watch-out for the rude hostess.  She can probably tear your head off with her looks."
"The steam juicy buns are juicy, however, there are other Shanghai restaurant that makes them just as good without the wait or the crowd.  I really don't like the crowded tables where you literally elbows to elbows with other people.  You feel like you are being rush all the time.  It is also cash only.  I am a patron of chinatown eatery for a long time.  This restaurant is a bit overhyped and is not the only restaurant that has very good juicy buns."
"Service is spotty due to crowds and language barrier, but food is delicious!  Dumplings are amazing and the sesame chicken was wonderful.  The Chinese beer is weak, but after a couple, they are pretty good, too :)  Can get very crowded with a wait; seating is common, but enjoyable when you find someone to talk to.  Highly recommend!  Cash only; no credit cards."
"Our friend raved about this place so he took us to this little gem in Chinatown.  We ordered  Fried Fish Cake with pork, soup dumplings with crab and pork, fried bean curd with vegetables, and sauteed crystal shrimp 

Everything was very tasty and delicious!"
"Real Chinese food, and the dumplings are something else.  You have to know how to eat them as they are filled with a liquid as well as the meats.  You suck out the juice and then devour the rest of the dumpling.  The other dish was large as well and the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive."
"It's so busy that the line is long, the food is inconsistent, and the servers are rude.   They rush you to get the rest of the cattle in.  BTW its cash only and the tip (15 %)  is included regardless the service."
"Believe the reviews.  This place is famous for their soup dumplings, and rightly so.  I had read about Joe's Shanghai over a year ago in the New York Times.  We go to New York City once or twice a year and decided to make the trek to Pell Street in Chinatown just to try the soup dumplings.  It was worth it.  They are great.

The dumplings themselves are like little ""pillows"" filled with a tangy soup as well as a mixture of pork and crab, with a little citrus flavor.  They arrived freshly steamed and very hot.  You might want to wait a few minutes before eating or risk burning your mouth.  Then there is the question about how to eat them.  Do you just pop them into your mouth whole?  Should you take a little bite from the perimeter and suck our the soup before eating the rest of the dumpling?  There are discussions on Chowhound regarding this topic.  We tried both methods, each with success.  

We had eaten a late breakfast and 2 orders of soup dumplings filled us up.  The restaurant has an extensive menu which we will explore on another visit.

Several reviewers commented about the long wait to get in the restaurant.  We went to Joe's Shanghai at 11 am, when they opened, and did not have to wait"
"this is a a great authentic shanghainese restaurant.  I am shanghainese and it is very close to my mom's shanghainese cooking.. if you like chinese food, this is a must go.. their soup buns are a must and their salt and pepper pork is a must.."
"After hearing all the recommendations i made a trip here.it wad a short wait in queue and once seat food came quickly.the pirtions were big and very filling.we tried the dumplings ,they were ok lacking a bit of taste.we ordered scallion pancakes,singapore noodles and shanghai noodles.they were value for money and nice not amazing though"
"Our 4th time at Pell St ( off Mott St,near the NQR Canal St station) and still New York's best food and value restaurant.Great atmosphere.Don't let the queues outside put you off- average 20 minutes to get in.
8 soup dumplings are a juicy starter.The main courses are large so don't overdo the sides! Service is fast and polite.
I had a veggie dish of Bean Curd house style- was delicious!
We paid 45$ for a starter and 2 main courses- a nice touch was Chinese tea to greet and fresh oranges to finish.
STUNNING!"
My normally wary kids couldn't get enough soup dumplings - proving that good is good no matter what the cuisine.
"This hole in the wall is crowded for good reason. The photo next to this review chart shows their famous soup dumplings, famous for good reason. The rest of the food is very good, too. Service is sloppy but that's what one expects, and you do get your food, which is why you came."
"We were wondering around Chinatown looking for somewhere to eat but a lot of the places looked like they were closing up or were really empty.

We walked past this place and noticed people queuing outside! Not that we're sheep but we thought it must be good and joined the queue.

We only had to wait about 5 minutes until we were seated - the restaurant is mostly large round tables and you sit wherever there's space! Not the place for a romantic meal if that's what you're after but a good atmosphere.

We had the pork dumplings to start with which were amazing! We then had sesame chicken and peppered beef which were just as good.
Portions were really big - we could have probably got away with having just the dumplings and chicken but we were feeling greedy..

When we had finished and got the bill we were pleasantly surprised - a lot cheaper than the other places we had visited in New York."
"Joe's Shanghai on a Friday afternoon was definitely packed with crowds of hungry families-be prepared to wait and share a table with them!  Just flew in from Atlanta, Ga and visiting with friends...what a wonderful way to enjoy my first moments in NYC since 2000..definitely enjoyed the dumplings-with the pork and shrimp fillings-they were hot, juicy and so deliciously filling...I didn't think I could eat more than 1 or 2 but had 4!!  Not a fan of quail-a little dry and not much flavor..However, the highlight of this meal was the braised duck...a bite of heaven...succulent, tender and rich with flavor, I just never thought I would like duck so much (have had it before but never cooked like this)!  It also was swimming with brown gravy to perfectly team it with rice!!d  The service was not bad, the atmosphere-well, don't expect much-people come to eat and enjoy then leave..A great ""welcome to NYC""..."
"Like the  ""soup dumpling"" Other items usual fare, found the lines and crowds not worth it  Other places such as 100 Mott has just as good fare"
"Fun with friends and be prepared to wait outside for a table (even if it's pouring rain).  gotta try the soup dumplings, but make sure you ask how to eat them or risk scorching your mouth with the hot soup inside."
"We ate here at 2pm on a Monday and every seat was filled.
The waiter made great recommendations. he let us know they were famous for their dumplings. We had one order and the couple we sat with had three! Its just that good.
there was a line out the door on Sunday and we know why. Don't let a wait dissuade you from trying this gem. The staff is very good at ""turn and burn"". we saw people sit eat and pay in under 20 minutes (that's New York, at its best)
Loved it. Go across Pell street for a massage after!"
"If you try this you will agree with me! Service is ok but food is amazing!

"First of all for people who are touring Chinatown, Pell St is a famous street where movies have been filmed and it really gives you the Chinatown atmosphere, as do most of the surrounding streets.   But, those soup dumplings are one of the most awesome I have ever eaten in NYC."
Joe's Shanghai is known for its soup dumplings which are very good. The wait can be long and be prepared to sit with people you don't know. I have ordered other things on the menu but nothing special. The dumplings come out fairly quickly. Joe's is worth a stop if you are in Chinatown.
"Cash only.  Food was mediocre.  Expected more from a highly rated restaurant.  Ordered the soup dumplings - they were O.K.  Jellyfish appetizer was pretty good.  The spicy shrimp was nothing special, even though the waiter recommended it highly."
"Yes it's true. I had the best Chinese food in China Town in NYC. I knew we would have a very nice experience from the que in front of the restaurant :) But it was certainly worth waiting. 
You should try dumplings. Fried noodles were also the best I had ever had
Take into account they only accept cash."
"They evidently have a wait to be seated most evenings, and they turn the tables....but do they have to be so rude.  I think our waiter even rolled his eyes in addition to being very curt.  We enjoyed the crab dumplings and shanghi noodles.  We couldn't ask many questions, so poll the crowd out front for the best dishes....we did!  Gratuity was included (probably only way they receive any) and they don't accept credit cards."
"Best soup dumplings in new york city! 
A real new york experience just finding this restaurant but well worth the effort to make it to Chinatown and find this gem.  Other dishes are great there too, but what makes this place memorable are their soup dumplings.  A real must when visiting nyc and chinatown."
Joe's has the best wonton soup anywhere.  The dumplings are also top notch.
Great place in the heart of Chinatown. Try their dumplings. You get seated on round tables with 10 people and it's quite fun. Waiters are good to reccomend dishes if you are not an expert in the Chinese cuisine. Try it!
Good Chinese food and certainly value for money. Ambience can do with a bit more of colour and better seats but certainly clean. Had good meal and can recommend the duck.
"Food was average, I ordered the dumplings and they were ok but my noodles were still frozen in part!

The waiters seemed uninterested and non engaging, they appeared and were arrogant.

When we got the bill, before being asked if we wanted a sweet or even coffee I left an average tip of ten percent, to my absolute shock the maitre de complained that it was customary to tip at least 15% !! Can you imagine my response."
"How this place got so famous and such high rating is BEYOND me! This place is the opposite of ""best soup dumplings ever"" - what are people smoking?! The dumplings were just awful: greasy, big and rough textured, there's no art in making this here. The service was horrendous, waiters rushed by without a smile and dropping dishes off. 

Total tourist rip-off - would recommend this place only to my enemies."
"Joe's is an experience -- it is loud, very busy, anxiety-inducing, but also tasty and a good value. Their specialty is steamed buns and they were good. The extensive menu allows for all sorts of dishes, but you may not have room for them because you are sharing your table with several other parties. Be forewarned, they accept cash only."
Tucked away in Chinatown. This place does one things extraordinarily well - dumplings. I preferred the pork. Somehow when I went there was no line. I enjoyed sitting next to people I didn't know and sharing what some believe to be a sacred experience. I will return here every time I'm in the city.
"We headed down to Chinatown with only one recommendation and it is certainly a recommendation we are thankful for!  We turned the corner and knew exactly which restaurant was Joe's - it was the only one with a line out the door (or a full dining room for that matter!).  The line moved quickly and we were seated at a table that was already half occupied.  But that's just the way it works there.  And for the record, I'd much rather share a table with strangers than have to wait longer to eat there!  
Soup dumplings are a must.  Hot and sour soup was okay, not great.  All entree dishes were delicious.  
The service is not going to be the highlight but it's not supposed to be...the food more than makes up for it!"
Great dumplings and they know it-be prepared to be asked right away what type you want.  Go with crab.  The service was not very good.  We had to ask for rice.  Despite the service I would eat there again.
Yum.  Great food and service...and soup dumplings!  If you can make it to the one in Chinatown give it a try...Midtown has nicer decor but is more expensive.
Very good soup dumpling a must eat.  The thing I dislike is the long line waiting both lunch time and dinner time... go there at 11:00am for lunch or 5pm for dinner.... Enjoy the food and people waiting to get in...
"This restaurant was recommended in our Rough Guide to New York. It wasn’t that easy to find we walked past it at first, but that wasn’t a surprise because China town is full of restaurants and signs flashing here there and everywhere.

We got in early (1830hrs) and the restaurant was packed, I always think that this is a good sign. We ended up on a communal table and shared with 2 other couples. This didn’t bother us too much as we stopped in here after a long day walking and were pretty cold and tired by this point. The service was quick; the idea of turning tables was a high priority in this restaurant.

The food was pretty good although everything turned up in a very bizarre order; I think they were struggling to keep up as it was so busy. We got our mains before our starters but then had no rice and even after to pointing this out to the waiter he didn’t seem particularly phased at all. Eventually the starters and rice turned up so we ate everything all at once!

We ordered a portion of dumplings which were pretty good and we shared a main, it was a decent size and again was nice enough.

The guide had hyped this restaurant up to be something special and for me it was fairly average, I have no doubt where were plenty of places where we would have had a terrible meal but I came away a little disappointed but I’m  not sure why really.

Overall I would say that although the kitchen sent things out in a bizarre order that I would eat here again, the food was quick, hot and reasonable priced but if you are looking for somewhere fancy to eat then I’m not sure this is the right place to go."
"We had a great meal here, very tasty & our cheapest in New York!!  It was pretty hard to find Joe's, it's on a side street, but worth the walk.  We started with the crab & pork dumplings, as I'd read here that that was their specialty and a favorite.  They didn't disappoint!  Steaming hot, very flavorful, full of meat.  There were 4 of us and 8 dumplings are served, plenty for an appetizer.  Portions for their entrees are large so don't order too much!  And cash only - not a lot of atmosphere & you sit family style.  We sat with another party of 4 and they were friendly."
"I had a Chinese customer of mine at home recommend Joe's to me.  We had already planned to go to Chinatown to explore and shop so we planned on lunch there.  We had fun walking to get there.  It was on a neat little side street that could be missed.  A very friendly older couple (Jewish I think) who had lived in the area all of their lives stopped us when they saw us looking at our map and offered to help us find something.  They were so fun to talk to! They were so full of NY personality and so friendly.  They loved their neiborhood and had me enthralled with their conversation.  after we told them we were going to Joe's they informed us that all of the restaurants here were great and informed us that Pell st where the restaurant is was featured in the Arnold Schwartzaneger movie ""Erasure"".  I will have to watch that again.
    Anyway, we found the resturant and they were busy.  We didn't have to wait but we got the only two empty seats at the time.  We were seated at a large table with two Chinese family's and a nice couple from Puerto Rico.  One of the Chinese family's we found out live upstairs.  They were very friendly but didn't speak English.  We did enjoy the atmosphere although it wasn't very fancy. 
  A waiter sooned came to us and quickly asked if we wanted dumplings, crab and pork or pork.
We said crab and pork and he was quickly off!  I guess they know what people come for.  We soon got the dumplings and menus in hand.  The dumplings came soon hot and steamy.  They were delicious and no to be missed.  Another couple at our table were having whole fried sea bass and it looked great so we also ordered that to share.  It came with a wonderful spicy brown sauce on it and steamed rice.  
   The service was ok not great.  The Chinese customers that come a lot definitely received the most attention from the servers and manager, but that's ok, the food was great and whole Chinatown experience was great!
'"
I really enjoy the food here.蟹粉小笼包超级好吃！！！味美多汁~~~~~~~the crab dumplings are sooooo delicious.
"We read that the service was sketchy but didn't find that at all for ourselves. We went to the 9 Pell St location. The food was good and unique, not typical Chinese fare. We thought the prices were reasonable. Evenn some options on the menu for those interested in trying something unique. Great service."
"It would be the crab soup dumplings ....ok the pork ones are almost as good.  No atmosphere, just a bustling authentic Chinese restaurant in the heart of China Town.  One steamer can feed one person, trust me you won't want to share.  Great food and cheap."
"A definite NY icon for dumplings. Make sure you stop by here to get your fix with a decent variety of dumplings. I love the pan fried ones, shanghainese dumplings and grab some spicy veges on the side. Satisfyingly good for a good price."
"We went to Joe's Shanghai to have a late lunch/early dinner yesterday. We arrived at 4 pm and the place was crowded and very noisy. We got a table just next to where the waiters where getting spoons and stuff all the time.

Our waiter seemed very stressed and almost didn't take the time to explain what was in the food and as soon as my boyfriend had told the waiter what he wanted to eat the waiter started to leave. We called him back and gave him my order as well. He started to leave again so we had to call him back again to order drinks. I ordered a bottle of water and instead of telling me that they didn't have bottled water he just nodded, left and never came back with any water (just my boyfriend's beer). When we asked about it he said that they only had tap water.

The food was good. Nothing spectacular but good. As soon as we'd finished our food (I was still chewing) the waiter was there to take our plates and asked if we wanted something else. We said no and he appeared with the bill within a minute. The bill included tax and service charge but since we didn't have even money we gave him 41 dollars when the bill was 31 dollars. We waited nearly 15 minutes for our change but the waiter was gone. Ultimately we asked another waiter about our change and he apologized and gave it to us.

We're not going back there but seeing the other reviews here I'm guessing we were just unlucky."
"Ok, well at least it does not lie about the dumplings. Went to Joe's based on internet reviews as I didn't know a thing about Chinatown options. Had the pork dumplings and they were excellent. Otherwise, I was not that impressed. The prices are reasonable. I think the service was rather poor other than when you are first seated and they want to immediately know what you want to eat. They do have a large menu to choose from. My girlfriend and I had the spring rolls, sesame chicken, and the chicken fried rice. The food was average, but it did come in large portions. They have tables with six chairs and they try to use all six chairs as the place is rather small. You will most likely be eating with other customers, which was fine with us. Met some nice folks from Australia."
While there is usually a wait and the table are a bit crowded.  Think family style seating and plates.  The food is amazing and the soup dumplings are the best I have ever eaten.  Well worth the crowd and wait.
"I have already been to the mid-town location, so we decided to try the Chinatown restaurant.
The place is pretty small, and on a midweek night it was packed at 6:30pm. 
Nevertheless, the service was pretty fast, and the famous soup dumplings showed up on our table in no more than 10 minutes.
These soup dumplings are a Joe Shanghai signature, but are not clearly reported as such in the menu, so if you have doubts, ask.
The prices are cheaper than the mid-town location (which is a bit fancier), but here  they only accept cash, and they do not take reservations.
15% tip is already added to the check, so be sure not to tip twice for a service that's just acceptable."
"I found Joe's Shanghai many years ago and have frequented it many times with friends and family. The only setback to this place is it takes no reservation and it is down-town and quite a track from mid-town. 

However, it is worth the trip, even if it is just for the dishes that i will recommend. The two dishes you cannot miss here are the pork and the crab soup dumplings. Portions are generous and you should go in a group to benefit from odering and sharing the different dishes. 

I have also tried the mid-town location.... some-how, same name but different cook and not the same quality and texture. Stick with Pell street and you will not go wrong."
"Ok, my title is an exaggeration.  But it's still one of the best places in Chinatown.  And the soup dumplings are worth the trip downtown."
"Wow, after a bit of searching we stumbled across Joe Shanghai's down a side alley.  There are people hanging around outside but don't queue, just go in get a ticket and the host will come back out to seat you.   We were able to get a private table for two and were seated within 3 mins of waiting but the whole place was packed constantly ...a good sign, especially when the locals eat there.  Everywhere else just didn't seem to have the crowds in like this place.  We had the pork dumplings to start which were amazing and they bring you out Chinese tea piping hot which was lovely also and meant that we didn't have to spend lots of money on drinks and I think I am officially addicted to the stuff now!  The mains we ordered three dishes which was too much for the two of us as the portion sizes are huge so don't make the same mistake as what we did as we ended up with eyes bigger than our bellies.  The Peking duck or braised duck as its on menu was gorgeous and the meat was so tender but the highlight in mine and my boyfriends eyes was the crispy shredded beef....wow.  You have to try it as is out of this world.  After a long day of walking I was quite happy for the quick service as I wanted to just eat well and go home, which is what I did.  The atmosphere was good, staff quick and food was the best Chinese that we have both ever eaten, the Chinese in England just won't now compare.  Highly recommended."
"Joe's has 3 locations, Chinatown, midtown and Flushing. I have eaten in 2 of them. Have been there many times. It is a bit pricier than many others in Chinatown but it didn't stop me. The menu is huge and I probably have tried over 25 items. Don't forget to try the soup dumplings and order right away, they are made to order, I like the crab ones the best."
"We went with a large party to Joe's Shanghai. The service was excellent and the food was delicous. My husband and kids love the juicy buns (dumplings with a hot juicy broth inside). Sadly, I do not remember the names of the dishes we ordered but the steamed fish (entire fish) was very tasty! The only negative is parking is hard to come by!"
"Come hungry, eat fast and then you're asked to leave! The soup dumplings (xiao long paos)are worth the wait and the search for this place. The restaurant is located in an alley off the main street. IT was well worth the search for the taste - you need to know what to ask for! The problem - they dont have small tables, so you end up sharing the big 10 seater tables with other strangers - the good thing - you get to be lookey lous and check what they are eating and then pick and choose. everything in NY is expensive - so this was a bit pricey for us comng from the Bay Area, CA! But well worth the trek!"
"We went to this restaurant on friend's recommendation. The food was indeed amazing and the best i have had outside of China, but it is extremely rushed. Ou lunch was served very quick, but after 50 minutes we were expected to leave. Do not choose this place if you want somethinf more relaxinf or want to catch up with friends. Beware: unless you are a group of ten or more reservations are not accepted, also if you miss your slot by even 5minutes your table will be given to somebody else. Those who come without reservatio have to wait on the street for their name to be called. But as i said: food is great and with only 20 mins per person is a real bargain in NYC."
"We waited for well over an hour, closer to 2, for a table for four.  We heard the soup dumplings were amazing.  We were seated, and then found out that they only had pork soup dumplings.  We are vegetarians.  Granted, we should have done our own research.  We took our friends' word for it that they had both pork and vegetarian.  But I never would have waited that long for a plate full of ""so-so"" Chinese food.  I think you'll have a far different experience if you can enjoy the soup dumplings that they are known for."
"First place, go to the one in Chinatown, not in mid-town. But even the one in Chinatown has not lived up to what we remember from going there(many times) years ago....maybe the cooks are different. Still, the soup dumplings are special...get the ones filled with crab and pork. If you do not know how to eat them properly, and don`t want the soup inside the dumplings to squirt all over you ASK the waiter how to eat them."
We keep coming back for the soup dumplings and prefer the pork to the crab.  The fried dumplings and the spicy wantons are standouts also.  This place is a steal and a great fun place to get lunch or dinner.
"We did a little restaurant hopping in Chinatown. First stop, Joe's Shanghai for crap soup dumplings. The restaurant looks like every movie Chinatown restaurant scene. It was crazy crowded, we sat at a table with two Chinese people we didn't know and the waiter was surly. But, oh, the dumplings!They are delicious pockets of dough filled with the usual pork filling AND crab soup. Not to be missed.
Stop 2 - Thai Viet Phuong. Stop 3 - Hand Pulled Noodle Inc."
"The title pretty much sums up our experience.  We waited outside on the street until 2pm when we were reserved for.  We were warned not to come late or we may forfeit our table.  The food and drinks come out fast, and the quality was pretty good.  The atmosphere is hectic, with the loud noise, cramped seating arrangement, and rushed feeling you get as servers hover over you as your meal approaches it's conclusion.  Not bad for roughly $20 per person, but you must be okay with the atmosphere."
My husband is Cantonese and we have our favorite haunts in Chinatown.  We decided to see what the fuss was about at Joe's and found it to be OK but still prefer less touristy spots.
Great inexpensive chinese food in Chinatown. They basically throw the food on the table and we had to wait a half hour to get in at lunch time but it is worth the wait!
"I love this restaurant and so do many other people. Maybe it's not for everyone but it seems like it is. Often times you sit at a table with other people, especially if it's only the two of you. The menu has all the staple chinese dishes that are cooked well. The service is fast and efficient. The dumplings are famous for a reason. I like to try different things that I've never had before. You can do that here. For an appetizer I had jelly fish, after the crab & pork dumplings of course. The fish casserole was good, some of the fish were more chewy then tasteful, with a lot of tofu in there but the mushrooms were great, noodles were great, shrimp & scallops were good, broth was salty but really good. Soda came in a can. Jeremy Lin photo with the manager is hanging on the wall. I'll keep going to this place until the day I die. Maybe I'll see ya there."
Treid Joe's famous dumplings - both pork & crab - and both were good but not great. But they were cheap & plentiful. Good for midtown Chinese but this area is obviously not the best for Chinese.
"when deciding where to go for tradtional soup dumplings in nyc, i read many glowing reviews of joe's being the one heritage place that could not be missed.  i was misled, imho.  what i got was instead a very crowded experience, shared tables, and long waits for what turned out to be mediocre food.  plenty of better choices in the outer boroughs, and i will not be back."
"Visited this restaurant in NYC's Chinatown on Pell Street for lunch with a family of 5. The food was very good.

The restaurant is renown for their dumplings with soup in them. We found them to be very tasty. We also ordered the crispy beef and snow pea leaves and they were also very good. At lunch time the restaurant was very busy so we shared a table with another party of 5. We did not mind this at all. We noticed most tables had multiple groups. 

The decor is nothing to write home about but the service was efficient and helpful. 

We would return.  Total bill for a party of 5 was about $45.00."
"Busy place, got there at 6pm, got a table after only 15min waiting. Little to loud and stressful staff but the food was astonishing good!"
"If you're a tourist, you're lucky to know to eat here.  Order any of the dishes, even the jellyfish, and enjoy real Chinese food.  You'll sit with others, as they fill up the tables and it's actually great to meet other diners. Look at what the Chinese dinners are eating, and just ask your waiter if you can have the same dish.  You will enjoy this place."
"Dumplings were good...a little hard to eat with chopsticks, but we knew what to do having read the reviews.  Ordering a la carte, the crispy beef was excellent.  Shrimp and hunan pork were okay, not much taste to the shrimp.  Prices were reasonable considering it was a full meal.  

Hard a hard time understanding some of the waiters' English...and I understand Chinese!

We went at 3pm...hoping to avoid the mealtime rush.  It was still busy, but manageable.  We were able to get away with using this as our big meal of the day...we were that full."
"The walk through Chinatown was part of the adventure! Just be prepared to wait a while (outside) when you get to the restaurant.  Yes, the first question they'll ask you is if you want the soup dumplings.  Just answer ""YES""...2 orders (because 1, I promise, will not be enough!)  Oh, and stick with the pork...and nothing else."
"For the same delicious food in a nicer setting, with friendly management and a great service - Joe's Shanghai on West 56 is the place. And they do catering too!"
"If you are a weekend dimsum regular like me, you will find joe's shanghai a breath of fresh air. how they manage to stuff a soup into the dumplings is beyond me, but do they taste good?! i will definitely go back again soon."
"Introduced to Joe's by a NY native friend.  Its delicious, he did the ordering so can't recall what I had."
"The place was suggested by my friends with whom I went there.  The place was packed and our group of 7 was told we would have to wait 20 minutes, after less than 10 we were seated.  The food was very tasty and came out very fast.  There are lazy susans in the middle of large tables so that made the tasting of different dishes easier.  Try their soup dumplings, they were definitely the right thing to get.  Otherwise you can stick with general chinese food you can find anywhere else (sesame chicken, general tsao) or be more adventurous for the sea cucumber.  The place was packed so I am sure anything you choose will be delicious.  Definitely worth the short wait."
Joe's is famous for their very delicious soup buns (known as Juicy buns) and these are the best in the City.  Enjoy!
"One of many good chinese places, but nothing unusual or special"
Of course yo need to get the soup dumplings (make sure you know how to eat them).  The pork shoulder is to die for.
"This place is great. They have 3 locations (Midtown, Chinatown and Queens). To avoid the crowds the location in midtown is a great option. The must have item is their world famous soup dumplings. They are amazing!"
"Ambience is not all that, but folks here come for the dumplings, which are delicious."
"You might have to take a number to be seated but usually the wait isn't too long, they move quickly. You'll sit around a large table with people you don't know. Doesn't matter, everyone is there to eat the food and people usually keep to themselves. The people sitting at the table when you arrive will be gone and replaced by others in short order. The waiter will ask ""How many""? What kind? He means how many soup dumplings do you want and what kind of filling, pork or crab? They are famous for their dumplings and you should really have some, they are delicious. The other food on the menu is also really very good. Service is quick and attentive, the price is reasonable but they do not accept credit cards. You will enjoy yourself."
"It's a shared table, which is fun. Go with friends. Soup Dumplings are a given. Share some food."
"WOW.  A nice surprise for all of us.
Excellent dumplings (get the crab and pork).  You will want more - and more - and more....... The entrees are good, but the dumplings are off the charts!"
"This place is not local-neighborhood friendly. The quality, service combine doesn't even appeal to us growing up eating chinese food...But since so many visitors prefer this place, I guess that's what you'll get, an average soup dumpling, soy sauce, msg drenched food."
"The dumplings are amazing.  My only regret was that our table did not order enough.  Next time I'd order mainly dumplings and maybe a couple real entrees.  Otherwise, the menu was reasonably priced and the other entrees we ordered did not disappoint.  Try the citrus chicken."
"They're famous for their soup buns I believe, which are good for NY standard. Other than that, the food is a bit greasier than your usual Chinese food. Not sure if it's the restaurant itself or maybe it's normal for Shanghai cuisine."
"The dumplings (xiao long bao) are actually pretty decent.  If you've been to Din Tai Fung in Taiwan, I might say it's actually a notch below the xiao long baos there (maybe I've been living in NYC too long). There's a decent menu selection and they're all reasonably priced too.  If I need a quick Chinese food fix, I'd much rather go to Joe's Shanghai than Chinatown.  The atmosphere here is a little more civilized too."
"I have been coming here for years,  and this place is a nyc must.
If you love dumplings... you will love soup dumplings.
I usually go here and only order the pork soup dumplings.. The rest of the Chinese food is great as well."
"Not the nicest of places, but the soup dumplings are worth going back for."
"This place was once one of the best in NYC, but they have declined.Food is now only average service is openly hostile, & most asians in chinatown now choose other places to eat. There are lots of better places within 3 blocks of there"
"Joes Shanghai is a must visit but be prepared for the controlled chaos inside! It was an experience to say the least.  Nobody told us about the seating.  There were two of us and we sat at a table of 12 with other folks we had never met.  Uncomfortable at first but ""when in Rome"" We laughed our whole trip about the experience.  The dumplings are very good and the food was quite tasty! Open mind and chinatown is a trip!"
"On est probablement resté au max une demie heure. Le service était vraiment fast, peut-être un peu trop même. Les dumplings étaient délicieux ainsi que les calamars. Rapport qualité-prix : excellent ,Super bien situé. près de central park.

S & G de montreal"
"The best dumplings I've ever had in my life!! Soooooo good. I have dreamt of them ever since. Really busy place so you might have to wait for 20-30 mins but it's well worth it. The staff are friendly and efficient and the prices are very reasonable. We had the steamed pork (soup) dumplings, scallion pancake, fried rice, Kung pao chicken and crispy duck - all were very delicious. They have 2 restaurants - both are great but the Chinatown one is more authentic. A must-do in NYC."
"Food is terrific and, as busy as it was in NYC during the holiday season, they pulled of great service too."
"Place was crowded and seating for two is with strangers at a large round table for eight so don't expect any privacy and New Yorker's are generally friendly but I still prefer to dine without strangers, so have at least four in your group or be prepared to watch your neighborhood diners manipulate chop sticks or discuss their newly revealed pregancy to the screams of her bf. The portions are large and food genuine, fresh and hot and tasty and the reputaton of the no doubt well deserved. The crowed suggests the turnover forces the freshness of the food and the faces, No credit cards all cash so I hope Uncle Sam eats there too!! this place does a bundle no doubt. A little tricky to find it but it not too hard, follow your nose to the big green sign between all the other similar fare dining establishments. The dumplngs were not as good as I recall in Nanjing but the boiling water in them just as hot, make sure your drain'em before attempting to eat, if not familiar. Duck was a bit greasy, but hey that is what makes it taste good. Seafood noodle dish was plentiful and tasty. Consistency is worth a revisit but perhaps with a larger crowd like 8 to fill the table with non-strangers."
We went here with a friend and had a variety of different dishes. Most notably the Shanghai Dumplings which were great. Service was also good and the people were fast and friendly. We went here a regular week-night and it was quite packed. We will definitely come here again.
"Had joes dumplings for starter and tgese were amazing never had b4 but great, then had spicy beef chow mein which was also really tasty 
The tea was good also after a long flight this was ideal. 

Service though is different we couldnt tell if our order had been taken or not, 2 different people asking  food was brought to table placed down and left, trying to get attention for something else like another drink or the bill is almost impossible. 

Well priced also"
"I do NOT know what the hype is with this place. 
The Shanghai Dumplings were OK; definitely NOT the best. 
The 'skin' on the dumpling was too dry and thick. It was Not silky nor was it yummy. 
The filling in the dumpling (we got the Crab and Pork) was OK. 
The ONLY thing i liked was the soup IN the dumpling. that was flavorful and thicker than usual. 

The other dishes were really quite bland/ boring. 

Summary:
- Shanghai Fried Rice- Pretty yummy. 
- Yang Chow Fried Rice- that was OK. 
- 5 Spice Fried Chicken. SO BLAND. I don't know why they wouldn't just marinate the chicken and coat it with the 5 spice instead of bringing out the salt in a separate dish. 

We also ordered 2 different dishes which LOOKED and TASTED exactly the same except they were served on 2 separate plates and with 1 different ingredient. 
HELLO? 

I felt completely ripped off.
I also just found out that the Service charge/ TIP has already been added to the check- i paid an EXTRA 15% for so-so food and bad service? FAIL

No more Joe's Shanghai for me- I can get MUCH better dumplings from random dimsum places in SF or LA and definitely Way better ones in Asia. 

Fail"
"I have grown up in Taiwan, with the privilege to all kinds of Chinese food.  This restaurant serves very authentic Chinese food.  All dishes we tried were well made.  It is totally worth the visit to me and my wife.  However, you must not mind the crowd.  It seems to be always packed, early or late."
"I've had the opportunity to eat here quite a few times and the soup dumplings are always fantastic. As far as the other food on the menu is concerned, its hit or miss. After the first 2 times I ordered things other than soup dumplings, I was let down and wished I just ordered more dumplings. The restaurant is very small and always packed. If you like eating at a community table with 2 or 3 other parties (which I absolutely hate) then I wouldn't stop here as there are other places that make a good soup dumplings. In fact, I would rather head to their uptown location as the food is the same but you just pay a little more....definitely better atmosphere and bigger restaurant."
"loved the scallion pancakes, dumplings, and crispy beef.  be prepared to make new friends -- they seat you where there is space.  It reminded me of being in Hong Kong."
"For starters, don't order the bone-in crispy chicken.  However, once you've had the opportunity to dine at community tables with mostly local Chinese diners, you'll see that the strategy is to see what everyone else is ordering and follow suite. The common theme is pork dumplings and huge bowls of glass noodle soup with meat of your choice. Although the staff are a bit intimidating with their constant hovering, you get great service and a wonderful meal at a good value."
"The food was so awful, I cannot begin to describe it.  I consider myself a connoisseur of Chinese food but this was really terrible.  The dumplings were barely edible and the rest of the meal even with shrimp and lobster was a disaster.  The service was equally poor and it did not help that there was a large pile of garbage outside the premises. See pic."
"Years ago Joe's Shanghai was an oasis in Manhattan - a place connoisseurs of Shanghainese cuisine could go to feel at home again and a place New Yorkers could go to experience a taste of Shanghai.  Today its a tourist trap, where prices are higher than surrounding restaurants and the food is cooked in so much of a hurry that quality could not be achieved even if it was intended.  Most disappointing, the famous xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are so inferior to others in the city that they are no longer a selling point.  Still, for those who have never experienced a soup dumpling even a bad one will impress and the lines, hurried atmosphere and communal seating may charm those for whom it is a first time experience.  But for those looking for the best soup dumplings in Manhattan I would suggest trying 456 Shanghai around the corner and up the block (69 Mott & Canal).  And, if you ever find yourself in Shanghai, the gold standard on which to base all other soup dumpling can be found at Crystal Jade in Xintiandi."
"We went to Joe's based on a recommendation from a local, I'm not really sure what they like about this place but it was pretty pathetic.  Food was sub-par and the waiters make you feel like you're in a race to who finishes first. Be warned, you will probably be seated with other fellow diners, this was our case - so don't walk in expecting any privacy. I would not come back. I personally prefer Dim Sum a Go-Go."
"Soup dumplings are excellent! The rest of the food didn't dissappoint either, well worth the trip into Chinatown."
"There are a lot of tourists at this restaurant that I'm sure found their way to the restaurant because the concierage at the hotel recommended the place.  However, there are a lot of local Chinese and their families there as well.  If you are uncomfortable sitting at a table that seats 8 but you are only two then this place is not for you.  It's noisy, crowded, often a long wait (20 - 30 minutes) for dinner but worth every moment.  The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable.  DO NOT go there and order your usual of chicken and broccili.  Live it up and try some of the dishes that you see the Chinese locals eating.  Also, order and share!  You must have the soup dumplings because they are fantastic.  You bite into the dumpling and there is some delicious soup and your meat in there as well.  I've gone there just to eat the dumplings...a must!  The staff are busy and moving around a lot but you always get what you want without an issue.  I highly recommend this place."
"We used to live near by and would visit at least once a week.  Avoid going on weekends if you can.  It's a Chinatown restaurant, so leave high expectations for decor and service at home.  Besides the crab & pork dumplings, which are a must, the salt and pepper shrimp, pork's shoulder, and rice cake dishes are stand outs.  The Chinese vegetable dishes are well prepared here as well.  We've also been to the Joe's in Flushings.  The food there is nearly indistinguishable."
"What to know before eating here.
1. You will wait...there is almost always a line..worth the wait.
2.  It is likely you will be seated with strangers, be friendly we helped novices order and made recommendations.  Of course the man who needed his lady to cut his food for him was a tad strange.
3. You will be asked what type of dumplings you want, crab/pork or pork.  Everyone goes for the dumplings, which I have heard are the best outside of Shanghai.  These steamed gems will come out and after your first bite you will be in heaven....
4. There is a proper way to eat these..you want to avoid spilling the soup...which is divine
watch the Asians do it..or go online for a tutorial
5. I also recommend the whole chicken, which takes 20 mins so order as soon as you are seated, the stringbeans and Shanghai noodles
6. The only negative is......BEWARE of the gratuity added to your bill because it is not clear and you might double tip which is exactly what they want you to do.   I left a bit extra over the 15% and the waiter was not pleased.  Most people do not realize that they are being overcharged."
We stopped by during our visit to Chinatown due to other trip advisor reviews. We had to wait more than 30 minutes to be seated at a shared table. The waiter was rushed and not attentive but the food was great. I cook Chinese food at home and have discerning taste. The food had great flavor and cuts of meat were quality.
"We have been going to Joe's for years for the pork soup dumplings, but were quite  disappointed the last two visits as we felt that the dumplings had gone down in quality.They are just not as good as they used to be, and taste more like the inferior ones served in Joe's on 56th St.  A Chinese family sitting at our table also suggested that we not order one of the most popular dishes they had ordered, as they said it was not very good.   
The NYC ""B"" rating was also disappointing...... 
It's very unfortunate..... it used to be such a great place!!!!!"
"We went to eat here this October 2011 because of rave review I heard. The soup dumpling is just so-so. I have eaten better soup dumpling in Shanghai, Hangzhou and Xiamen. Not really worth it to wait in line, just go eat NYC pizza. That what famous in NYC - Pizza!!."
All we got were the soup dumplings and they were incredible.  Service was crap but that's what you expect from a divey place in Chinatown.
Great place to eat in Chinatown!  I must admit if we were not with a native New Yorker we would not have had a clue how to eat dumplings - but what fun it was learning.  They were delicious!
"I had visited Joe's Shanghai on 56th St last year and was impressed. Their ""restaurant"" on Pell St looks more like a canteen (big shared round tables), so please do not expect a romantic meal in a relaxing environment and never go with the intention of having a conversation while eating, for it is extremely loud here and the service is hectic and not particularly friendly. Do go there to enjoy a good ice-cold Tsingtao beer and their delicious pork&crab dumplings though, they are indeed even tastier than those served on 56th St. Be prepared to wait! We showed up for late lunch (maybe early dinner for some other cultures? ;) It was around 3pm) and were seated after about 25 minutes. 

I suspect we were also victims of the ""hidden-15%-tip-phaenomenon"", so we probably double-tipped, which is disgusting, especially if I think back of the poor service received!! Why do they do this, it's so irritating! I'm sure they could get in big trouble for that. 

Needless to say, the four stars are for their dumplings only. Worth a visit if you're in town!"
"We always visit Joe's when we're in town.  Love the soup dumplings, and usually get a few other appetizers and snacks and dim sum to complete the meal.  Pretty room, good enough service, and not overly expensive.  Dumpling fans, don't miss these special treats."
"This is my usual dinner destination when ever i have friends visiting from out of town.  Come in groups of 4 and more for your own table otherwise, you are seated at a communal table with other diners.  I personally prefer having my own table to enjoy my meal.  The SOUP DUMPLINGS and SCALLION PANCAKES are my favorite.  Every time I'm in the neighborhood, there's always a line waiting to be seated.  Normally i bail out once the waiting period exceeds 30 minutes, but my craving of the soup dumplings just makes the wait worth-it.  They  have other dishes that are very good as well,  but i feel i can get those at  nearby restaurants with no lines.  Just a warning though, please check your bill before paying, seems like there's a hidden 15% gratuity already added to your bill written in Mandarin."
"This is gross chinese food. Really, really gross. The service was awful, rude, and then added a 15% gratuity on but tried to hide it on the bill (successfully, so we ened up double tipping for a gross meal served rudely). We honestly ate two or three bites of one of the dishes and only have of the other. I can truely say this was some of the worst and most oily chinese food I've ever eaten - and I've been twice to China and multiple times to Hong Kong and been served my share of disgusting, greasy meals.  On my last trip to NYC last year I ate at a nearby vegetarian hole in the wall chinese place (no real name) and it was beyond excellent.  I cannot understand the good reviews. It totally baffles me that any human being would enjoy the food or the experience at this place. Our dishes had at least 1 cup of oil each. It was ridiculous."
"In Chinatown. Shared tables. Well known for dumplings or dim sum specialty: 2 types, pork or pork mixed with crab (my favorite), fabulous!. Do not go if you look for a regular Chinese restaurant though it has regular Chinese dishes which are o.k. too, but as I said specialty is dumplings or dim sum. We were in 2008 and now. Excellent!. Highly recommended!."
"Pros:
-the food was decent
-the waiter was quick and friendly
Cons:
-the hostess was rude
-the line was not worth the wait
-the food was too salty and greasey
-overpriced
-you even have to pay for the rice
-i have had WAY better Chinese food elsewhere, and i was disappointed because this restaurant came highly recommended by my friends
-they make you pay with cash, and they add 15% tip automatically ""for you convenience""

Overall, it is a decent restaurant, but not worth the wait or the price."
"The shanghai soup dumplings are to die for. Best in Chinatown....and cheap too...only 4.95 for pork and 6.95 for added crabmeat. The steamy buns come out hot...add some ginger soy and hot spicy oil, and you are all set. Our family usually gets 3 orders.

The seating is limited, so you may end up sitting with strangers, but that makes it a fun, social dining experience. Also great on the menu....jellyfish, scallion pancakes, best Kung Pau Chicken, and dry sauteeed stringbeans. Wait staff speaks multi chinese dialects and english too. 

Bring cash as tip is included in the bill. Great food, great price, and great experience"
"Seating was fast even thought there was aprox 15 persons before our turn.  All other restaurants  around were empty this one was busy all the time.  The seating is very interesting, they ask you  how many seatings would you need and  then mix your group with others at the same table, the thing is that you exchange opinions on what everybody is eating, since everyone orders different foods.  Food is really delicious and you can tell it was just made instantly.  Totally recommend the place. Good Pricing"
"I have eaten in mainland China and several China Towns around the world. This place is average. I have no idea why it is rated so highly. You have to wait (as it is full of non Chinese people), the food is mediocre and the service is poor even by Chinese restaurant standards. Try elsewhere."
"Me and my cousin Came to new York searched for a good Chinese resturant this one came up, got to the door was a 30 minute wait, finally got seated was seated with other people on a table. The food is poor, we are Chinese our selves and were shocked by the quality of food they served us, we got steamed dumplings which were not real tradiotinal dumplings for starters. For mean course we had sea food fried noodles, the noodles it self were cheap replacement foam noodles not used in authentic Chinese restraunt, we also got beef stir fry scallion that Tasted like propein, very oily, low quality beef used for the price it was at, the final meal we got was chicken fried rice it taste good but the chicken used was also very low quality meat. Overall not worth it plenty of tradiontal Chinese resturants around the corner"
"We Love the Dmplings at Joe's SHanghai - all locations!
Chinatown location is Favorite - Wait is worth it!  Fast paced Energy, fast service, great food and very inexpensive.   The kids love walking in Chinatown and then eating the awesome dmplings . ... lot & lots of dmplings!"
"Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings taste is beyond any other I've had.
They have 3 locations in New York. One in Flushing, one in China Town and one in Midtown. The one in China Town is always packed, you have to wait at least 20 minutes to get it. So I recommend the one in Midtown. It's the EXACT SAME dumplings with the big difference that you don't have to wait or share the table with anybody.
It's located at 4 W 56 Street (between 5 and 6 Avenue)."
"I rarely am willing to stand in line to wait for a restaurant, but my experience at Joe's was a pleasant exception to my rule.  We were wandering around Chinatown and found Joe's based upon Trip Advisor ratings and reviews.  The wait was almost an hour, but I can honestly say that I was happy to wait for what I got.

We were seated with several other people at a large round table.  The place was packed and very lively, but the service was very good.  We started off with the highly recommended soup dumplings, made with crab and pork.  This dim sum was delicious and a great start to a great meal.  I had breaded prawns in a light orange sauce.  Very tasty.  My friends had beef with broccoli and they were pleased as well.

This was some of the best authentic Chinese food I've ever tasted.  I would definitely return."
"Where do I begin? The place is fantastic. I love, when American people, have to travel to a place that's semi-unfamiliar and a little uncomfortable to experience something so great. The soup dumplings are outrageous! Most of the menu is great! I try and go as much as possible."
"We visited on a Thursday at about 6pm and were lucky to get a seat before the queue started. This restaurant is obviously very popular and we now know why! 

You are seated on shared round tables with other diners and the atmosphere is great. The pork and crab dumplings were amazing! Very big portions!

We also had the clams in black bean sauce and the beef special. They were both amazing! Great value for the quality of food and the portions.  I will definitely recommend this place to anyone! 

Service was prompt and I couldn't fault the whole experience.

Great restaurant!"
"Dumplings! Beef with Green Beans, Braised Duck.  It is like making a pilgrimage. It is great to sit at a large table with strangers and learn about food.  A must do in NYC.  I met a chef and author of many cookbooks while in little italy one day and asked her what the best italian restaurant in NYC was. She told me Peasant. I said great, now if I could just find the best Chinese. From around the market we were in several people all yelled in unison, ""Joe's Shanghai!!!!!""  Get there early for lunch, there will be a line after 11:30am."
"I LOVE the crabmeat soup dumplings, with a quick dip in hot sauce and vinegar soy.  Nothing else on the menu is worth mentioning, pretty standard, although the eel is decent and the Shanghai noodles hit the spot in the wintertime.  The crab dumplings, however, with scalding broth inside, the high degree of difficulty to extract the soup before it leaks out, even the random piece of shell every once in a while, make this place a destination stop (Pell St location)."
"This restaurant its a regular stop for us, everytime we go to NY city.

they are Zagat rated! 99%of the time there is a line, you may have to share a table with extrangers, but none of that is imortant once you trie their food.

They have the most amaizing soup dumplings! we Love them! we have not had a bad dish ever.

The service is pretty good. This restaurant its an atraction on its own, they have autographed photos of celebrities on their walls.

Make a stop, be patient, and experience Unvelievable food!"
"ATMOSPHERE: Busy, busy, busy.  If you are a small party of less than 3, expect to be sitting at a large table with a few strangers.

SERVICE: You will hardly have sat down before the server will ask you, ""dumplings or no dumplings?"".  Attentive to the point of overbearing.  Hand reaching in to grab your paper chopsticks wrapper.  Hand reaching in to grab you straw wrapper.  Got the feeling they wanted you to order quickly so the hungry horde waiting outside wouldn't riot.

FOOD: We were a party of 2.  Ordered the ""Siu Loung Bow"" which is Cantonese for their specialty dumplings --- steamed pork dumplings which are filled with soup inside.  There's no right way to eat the first few because they're temperature hot.  Set of eight.  Numbers 5 to 8 you can put the whole dumpling in your mouth without worrying about scorching your palate.  They were average in my opinion but definitely worth ordering.  

The other dish we had was General Tso's chicken.  Highly recommend this dish.  It's chicken breast pieces, lightly battered, deep fried and then bathed in a aromatic sauce.  The crispiness of the chicken gives this dish its zing. Comes with steamed broccoli and a bowl of rice.

If you're a party of 2, this will probably be enough.  We had half a bowl of rice and 30% of our chicken dish left unfinished and it wasn't because the dish was unappetizing.

Soda is $1.00 per can.  No complimentary refills.  Ask for a glass with ice.

PRICE: $27.  **They automatically add a 15% gratuity to your bill so don't double tip, unless you want to of course**

WOULD I COME BACK? Yes."
"Went to the midtown location(56th st) of Joe's looking for soup dumplings, hopefully as delicious as the ones we had eaten in SF last year. The dumplings were delicious and two portions of it plus one portion of chicken fried rice was plenty for us. It was easy to be seated since we arrived early for the evening(they were reopening, at aprox 5:30pm). Value was very nice too and we found easier to eat there than in SF chinese because menus and waiters are more friendly to non- chinese speakers."
"Go here if you're looking to eat large portions of good Chinese food at reasonable prices and don't care about the atmosphere.   Didn't especially like the pork dumplings but everything else was very good such as the shrimp dish and hunan pork which came with very fresh, crisp broccoli - my daughter just ordered their fried rice - it was enough for her and two more.  They will seat you at very cramped large round tables - gratuity is already included in price.  Service is good."
"We saw all the reviews, and the long line outside, and figured we had to try this place.  We tried their famous dumplings and, frankly, have had just as good elsewhere in Chinatown.  Our young son did really like the crispy beef dish we ordered, but I thought the ""chef's special"" chicken with chestnuts was bland.  Service was as chaotic as elsewhere in Chinatown, but prices were noticeably higher (still a bargain compared to almost any other NY restaurant.)  Overall, the meal we had was fine, but nothing outstanding and both more expensive and less enjoyable than we've had elsewhere in the neighborhood."
"still surprised how they put the soup inside, amazing! great place"
"probably worth going once, the dumplings were very good.  However this place is very very busy.  They move you in and out faster than any place I have ever seen.  We would not go back."
"We were only in NYC for one evening, and after doing some iPhone research, decided to eat at Joe's Shanghai.  What an experience.  We had to wait about 45 minutes, but the crowd of people milling around outside (where there are no seats, benches, or curbs to sit on) convinced us that this was worth the wait.  We told the lady who was seating people that we would be happy to share a table... needn't have bothered.  Everyone shares a table!  We ordered 8 or 10 items for our party of 5 (a vast amount of food, we found out later) and food started arriving immediately. Dumpling soup was fantastic.  Salt fried fish was amazing.  We had the crispy fried duck, which was so good, and beef with broccoli - which I have never had better.   We rolled out about an hour later, very full and very satisfied.  One of the better asian food experiences I have had!"
"Found this after review on Trip Advisor.  My kids had never had chinese before (sad I know) and I was nervous after a long day of sightseeing.  They LOVED it!  Communal style of eating wasn't a problem.....we had a table for 6 to ourselves for most of meal - after which a couple came and sat with us.  Waiters weren't overly helpful but they were busy and know they've got a good thing.  We ordered the soup doublings - steamed pork, beef lo mien and general Tsos chicken (not spicey). Kids loved everything!  Had to practically beg to have a waiter take an order for beer but other than that it was perfect.   Will recommend to anyone visiting the city!"
"This was our first visit to Chinatown and, following some research on the internet, we set out in search of Joe's Shanghai for dinner.  Arrived at Joe's and were seated at a table with another couple.  We started off with the crabmeat dumplings.  I thought I knew how to eat a dumpling, but once the waiter showed us the proper way to eat dumplings, I realize I hadn't had a clue.  They were delicious!  We ordered one soft-shell crab to split between us, as well as an order of bok choy.  Joe's Shanghei isn't fancy nor romantic by any means, but the overall experience of the communal eating, the dumplings, soft shell crab and cold beers was very enjoyable."
"My husband and I walked in on a Thursday afternoon and there was no wait.  We sat at the communal table and the other people seemed to be locals as they offered us their best recommendations -- always a good sign.  

We found Joe's Shanghai to be a very authentic experience.  The people who work there are not there to entertain you, but serve you good, hearty food that makes them an honest living.  The food was superb.  Of course, we started with the soup dumplings (pork).  They were delicious; the soup was rich and flavorful.  The pork inside was a generous amount and also so flavorful.  The dumpling itself had a very rustic, homemade quality -- perfect.  

I ordered chicken lomein and my husband ordered his favorite Chinese dish, General Tso's Chicken.  They were both well-known Chinese dishes and the best we have ever had.  There was no trace of MSG or anything fake -- just natural, homemade, authentic Chinese food.  

The price is right too!  It was not only one of the best meals we had in New York City, but by far the cheapest ... highly recommended if you are in Chinatown and want some TRUE Chinese cooking!"
"Not much to add to previous reviews - yes, we waited about 15 minutes (not much space, so we stayed outside).
Once seated the service was brisk and the food arrived fairly quickly, with a buzzy atmosphere to match.
The fried pork dumplings and spring rolls were okay - nothing to write home about here.
For main course we had large plates of Shredded Pork & Dried Bean (tasty if unspectacular),  the Shredded Beef with Green Peppers and Chinese Spinach were the stars of the show - we also order (too much) Singapore Noodles to balance things up - again, it was good, although it could have done with a better mix of meat and vegetables and a bit less oil.
All in all, if your are after a no frills great Chinese food, Joe's represents great value for money."
"What an experience this place was.  There was a little bit of a wait (30 mins), but no problem.  We took a walk around China Town and found a place that gave foot massages and made plans for later. 

There is a little bit of a factory feeling to this place.  You get your numbered ticket upon arrival.  Be alert and listen for your number. Once it's called get seated in close quarters.  Too bad we don't speak Chinese otherwise we'd have been best friends with the girls that were seated 12 inches from us.  Be prepared to order 2 mins after arrival.  The food comes fast, hot, and in huge portions. Eat with chopsticks. Pay in cash. Good Bye.

The food was delish and authentic.  The restaurant was loud with many different languages and a screaming child somewhere."
"Joe's offers an expansive menu of enormous portions for an extremely fair value.  That is probably why there is a 30 minute wait, or more to get in.  Fortunately we did not have to toil in the line and timed our arrival just as the hostess let our party in!  We did pass dozens of Chinese restaurants and then ended up at Joe's, which had dozens of people waiting outside to get in.  I found that ironic.

The atmosphere is festive and service is very good.  Probably so they can serve you quickly and get the next group in after you.  But I'm not complaining.

The largest problem I had was that I had no idea what to order other than the steamed dumplings, which it seemed every table had and therefore seemed like a no brainer.  They are that, they were excellent.  Best I've ever had!

The main courses, despite being sizable enough to feed two, were a little bland.  However, I would suspect that some of that had to do with not knowing what is good on the menu.

In the end, I would recommend Joe's for its fun atmosphere and low prices.  Maybe go with somebody who's been their before so you have and idea what to order."
"It was fabulous- so glad they seated us at a big table and usually not always game for that.  Everyone told us what to get, the sauces to prepare- it was great!  The Crispy Beef, Shainghai Noodles and these amazing Pork Dumplings, like dim sum filled with soup and prolk- divine, with the hot chili oil- to die for!  Walk around Cinatown after and get a great chair massage."
"Had lunch here today.  Just a 2 minutes wait and then shared a table.   Had the kung pau chicken and it was the best I've ever had.  

Have to say you can't get a lot better at any price and a large portion with rice and tea cost 13 dollars!"
"Soup dumplings here are unbelievable, so are the scallion pancakes, and just about any other dish but they are known for the dumplings.  Weekends here are killer, better to go during the week.  Cash only, usually always a line but it moves fast.  Keep in mind that they include the tip on the bill!!  Just thinking about it is making me hungry!  Super cheap, especially for NYC.  Go to the location in Chinatown if in Manhattan, the midtown location is not as consistent with the quality."
"Excellent dinner! There is a reason why this is the only restaurant in Chinatown with a line outside...
No credit cards or reservations accepted.
Show up and enjoy the ride"
"My family and I had Christmas dinner here this year. I had booked a table two months in advance and was a little annoyed about having to wait 20 minutes to be seated (I thought a reservation should prevent that?). However, after we got the table we were served straight away and enjoyed the best Chinese dumplings we had ever had. The dough is soft and the filling very tasty, you can't get enough! We had lots of beer and several other dishes (very good spring rolls too!) and still the bill was modest, surprisingly enough for a good location in central New York. I can only recommend it!"
"If you want Chinese food in New York, then go to this place. 

You don't get much better than this."
"If you want to have a romantic dinner with your girlfriend, or just spend some quiet minutes enjoying the private chat... then this plase is definitely NOT for you!!!
Always a lot of people inside and outside (many people awaiting to be seated - and that is actually very good sign!) You will not be given the chance to stay alone in this restaurant :) 
The portions - like at least for a GIANT and PERMANENTLY HUNGRY man! Even if you are very hungry - please be prepared that you will not be able to eat more than one course - they are really giant-size!  
The atmosphere is positive, servise is quick and food quality is high... and though I've never been to China - I think in Joe's Shagnhai you feel the real spirit of China.
My best recommendations to this wonderful restaurant!"
"You know it's gonna be good when you walk up and see it's packed at 2 in the afternoon on Tuesday.  The fried noodles with beef or chicken were great as were the steamed pork buns.  Loud, busy, bustling.  Great for groups or two of you sitting with people you don't know.  Service was quick and responsive.  Must eat here while in Chinatown!"
"im only grading based on their xiao long baos (those lil buns with soup in them) and what i would only recommend people to go there to eat. the soup in the bao is thick and full of flavor. i personally would prefer the same flavor but with less viscosity but this still worked out alright for me. there are definitely better ones around the world, but for those who might only get this chance in nyc, a definite try in my opinion. good stuff. 

as for the rest of their food... i opted them out of my grading because the xiao long baos are really good and don't want these other dishes to prevent others to even attempt to try the xiao long baos. i tried other dishes such as their fried dumpling and won ton soup. found the dough too thick for both of those and the fried dumpling being way too oily. i know it is supposed to be slightly oily since it is fried, but you don't see McD fries come out all oily now, do you?"
"Went here for a late snack around 430 on a thursday.  Ordered 1 order of soup dumplings, 2 pan-fried dumplings and a scallion pancake.  The soup dumplings were awesome.  The pan-fried dumplings were kind of small.  The scallion pancake was good.

It was not that crowded when we went.  Would recommend going during off-hours to avoid the long lines for this place.  Total bill was about $20."
"We were wandering around Chinatown without a plan, so basically we chose this because it was Monday night and they were the only place that had a line hanging outside..so we thought we'd check it out!  Wait was short (about 15-20mins) and we were seated at a large, round table with other diners like you would at a Japanese steak house.  
We ordered the traditional soup dumplings and they were the best I'd ever had!  Be careful when biting as the broth can spill out and is very hot.  We also ordered razor clams (this was not something I would do again),  sauteed chicken with ginger, and shredded pork with some type veggie.  The latter two were wonderful...but I had never had razor claims and it was not what I was expecting
Decor is not something you should be looking for, it's all about the food and the prices are great!  This was the most enjoyable meal (and cheapest) we had during our visit! 
I highly recommend it."
"I want to challenge the consensus amongst reviewers.  I actually think that the crab dumplings are better than the pork.  But they are both fantastic.  So, my advice order one of each and enjoy.  You won't need much else!"
"We were 20 people (had the private dining room upstairs) for a non-rehearsal rehearsal dinner prior to my nephew's wedding.  The restaurant is know for it's soup dumplings and they didn't disappoint...pretty amazing.  Our appetizers included the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and cold noodles with sesame sauce.

Our entrees were prawns, a fish dish (that was not great - very fishy tasting), sesame chicken,General T'so chicken, crispy pork chop, a beef dish and the spicy eggplant.  There wasn't a morsel left (except for the fish) of any of the dishes."
"You're not going there for the decor, so if that's something high on your list, you need not apply. Went to the location near Canal Street in Chinatown. I heard the midtown location was bad. Had the Soup Dumplings which everyone there was eating. Very good, but be very very careful, or you mess up your clothes or worse burn yourself. Also had the General Tao's chicken which was delicious. made from huge chucks from breast meat. Also had the Shanghai Flat noodles which was yummy. And finally ordered the jumbo fried prawns with chili, also very good. We sat a table with 7 other strangers whom we hit it off with within 2 minutes. We ended up sampling one anothers dishes. Fantastic."
"The food was second to none.  Small, crowded, and average service & cleanliness.  Easy to overlook any flaw once you taste the food."
"We saw the great reviews on Trip Advisor but I wasn't sure about the community seating.  Then I asked the concierge where to go for Chinese and she said Joe's.  So we decided to try it.  I missed the review that said the waiter comes around for dumpling orders so we were a bit clueless when he asked us.  Since we are used to getting pan-fried dumplings in other restaurants we ordered that.  Even though the waiter was pointing at the soup dumplings.  Then we asked our tablemates and they said we should order the soup ones.  So we told the waiter to cancel the pan-fried ones - he got a bit testy saying they were already ordered (we had the order in less than a minute) but he grudgingly canceled it.  When we ordered 1 each of the pork and the pork and crab soup dumplings - he made a point of telling us that we couldn't cancel it.

The soup dumplings were very good - we couldn't finish them all so we shared them with our tablemates.  We also got the pan fried noodles with chicken which was very good.  Our tablemate shared his dish - was like a scallion pancake - also delicious.

As has already been stated in other reviews, the tip is included (15%) which is fine - NOTE - they only accept cash - no credit cards."
One reviewer below said the dumpling skins are too thick. Nothinng could be more inaccurate. These dumplings are perfect. And the fried whole fish is spectacular. fresh vegetables in season are served if requested - our lunch included sauted been shoots. This is - in my humble opinion - the best Chinese restaurant in the LES.
"Once you eat here, you love coming back.  Sat at table of 10.  Mother and daughter from Texas just in.  3 English businessmen.  3 French women and us.  Everyone chatting within minutes.  As you sit waiter takes dumpling order.  Be prepared for this.  Get the pork.  1 order serves 2 people easily.  Tea is free.  

Then order from menu.  Get 1 less dish than # of people.  ALWAYS!  Maybe even 2 less.  This is huge quantity.  And, everyone else at table will order too much and give you some of theirs if you are friendly.  We ordered the Spicy Braised Yellow Fish.  It was excellent.  

The French ladies had a crispy (?) noodle dish with shrimp and brocolli.  My wife and I ate half of it since this was all left over.  They ordered dumplings x 2 and 3 mains.  They had a ridiculous amount of food.  Their bill was $46.  Ours was $18.  The English guys had 5 dishes, LOL.  

Don't wear fancy clothes.  You will get splattered when you bite into the dumplings.

Tips are included in the bill.  Clearly marked.

Cash only.  Be prepared to wait in line and share table.  Watch out for similarly named places, such as Shanghai Cafe and Joe's Ginger (which is almost right next door and may be same owner, but may not be).

Go with a hearty appetite and an openess to strangers."
"If one is looking for soup dumplings, this is the place in Chinatown. You might have to wait for a table at any time of the week. So please be prepared for that when you decide to visit.
Also, they do not accept credit cards. Make sure you are carrying cash.
Pretty inexpensive and great food. Have gone back thrice in a month's time."
"5stars for Pork dumplings, the rest 3stars, hence 4stars for average.
I would suggest sticking with pork over crab or you can be like the other newbs and try them for yourself then settle for pork in following visits. The dumplings are served 8 at a time, after having a few, you will understand why tea is served, to counter the fatty soup within the dumplings. Having said that, pork dumplings are delicious, the best around.
This place does require an overhaul. Service, cleanliness, and waitlist system can all be improved. Service is more of an obligatory requirement here, not sure who the client is. Cleanliness, look for yourself. Waitlist, often 3 parties are thrown in together on one table, I barely enjoy eating with my kids never mind strangers!
Ultimately, this place is popular because the pork dumplings over come all the minuses and more."
"Here's the bottom-line: Best pork dumplings anywhere, hands down. My friends and I also tried their Sesame Chicken, Beef and Brocoli, and Garlic Beef and were all very impressed. It is ridiculously busy but how could it not be with great food. The waiting staff is not the best as the 18% gratuity is built into every bill, no matter the group size. I would recommend coming here for a great lunch as you are whisked in and out fairly quickly. The food is great, fairly inexpensive, and right in the heart of Chinatown."
"In heart of Chinatown.

Not fancy as far as decor but excellent and friendly service and outstanding food.  All of the ""usual"" stuff you would expect plus those oputragious Soup Dumplings. (Eat them by picking up with soup spoon and chop stix and watch out when you first bite into it (SQUIRT)

No one will be disappointed.  ""Try it...you'll LOVE it""."
"if i want crab meat dumplings, this is the only one pick. so good. I prefer go to the Flushing branch. no matter where, it has the best crab meat dumplings if not in the world, then most of the world. even better than I had in Hong Kong--- price wise and quality."
We loved this restaurant very much for its great food and the price as well. Staff were very nice and pro. The Boss was really a smart men to control a very good restaurant like this. Hope to turn back soon.
"First off, the price.  Every time we have gone there, it has cost us 20 dollars a person with everything.  For Manhattan, dinner, that is fair.  And the portions are fine as well - although I never have leftovers.
Second off ,the wait.  Well, surprise!  A good restaurant has a wait, what a shocker!  Those that complain about the wait would just find something else to complain about if there was no wait.  They move it along as quickly as possible.  Just wait by the door outside until they call your number.  If you leave to go somewhere else, you may lose your place - don't complain.
Third off, the cleanliness.  Okay, on that one, I could see people that wish to complain.  If you have been to a traditional Chinese restuarant in a major city during rush hour, you are going to get some filth.  If you accept that going in, and realize you will live and are NOT there for the decot, you should be fine.
The food?  Just get the dumplings, yes.  Try the pan fried noodles and seafood.  If you are in a large party, have everyone order something different, and pass it around the lazy susan..
I have gone here many times, and will continue to go many times.  If you are turned off by other reviews, that's fine.  There are many great restaurants in the same area - but don't let the wait scare you!"
"After reading many reviews on Joe's on Yelp, we decided to drop by. When we first arrived, indeed it was very crowded. The waiting time was about 20-25 mins. We ordered pork and crab dumplings (their specialty). I prefer pork dumplings. In any case, I have eaten many better dumplings elsewhere. The dumpling skin was too thick, I feel. 

Other dishes that we ordered were just average. In fact, too oily. We spent US$40 for three of us, four dishes. The place is rather messy, with table sharing and all."
"Joe SH of Midtown in most part was a disappointment. We came to try their famous soup dumplings. We ordered crab and pork soup dumplings, chives pancakes, Kim chi and ice cream. We liked the soup dumplings, but after tasting those at Chinatown Brasserie understood the difference and it was not Joe’s dumplings that won the competition.  The ice cream was great, but all the rest (including the very bland jasmine tea) was lower then average. Ambience is nice, service is OK, cleanliness is questionable (we had to wipe our utensils and sent the napkin with the spots on it back), but all together does it worth spending that much money???  Honestly, we don’t understand what all the hype is about?!"
"We arrived at this restaurant in the pouring rain at 10pm but I was not worried about this because NY seems to keep going 24/7. However, they told us that the kitchen was closing soon so we'd have to hurry up or go somewhere else before we'd even sat down!
We wanted to order about 3 dishes but the waiter refused and said he only order two for us!! I was horrified, I've never been treated like this!
As it turns out, two dishes were plenty for two people however, they could have explained that to us rather than refusing to give a paying customer a choice. The food was lovely but it felt like they were rushing us and were grumpy serving us. Appearance of the restaurant was poor and the staff were rude and I would not go here again."
"The pork dumplings were delicious as usual and very nice, friendly service.  Sesame chicken was dry and overcooked.  Took a newbie there and was disappointed in the meal, though the dumplings were as delicious as ever."
"Soup dumplings DID live up to hype...place WAS crowded for sure...seemed clean to me...and cost WAS fair.

Don't go if you want a small, quaint, romantic Asian dinner...this place is busy and the food is good.

I preferred the pork dumplings over the crab but both were good."
"Amazing juicy dumplings.  They are yummy, big and addictive."
"Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown is practically the only thing I really miss about New York.  I crave their soup dumplings and must go there everytime I'm back in New York.  In fact, the goal is to go there more than once but that doesn't always happen.  The soup dumplings are the best I've ever had as are the shredded radish buns.  And being Chinese who grew up in Seattle and went/go to Vancouver fairly often, that's saying a lot.  I told my coworker to go there when she went to NY for the first time with her two teenage sons and they loved it so much they ate there twice!  And they're born and bred Minnesotans.  Do be prepared to sit at a round table with strangers if you're a small group.  But, that makes it fun because you can see what they're eating and get it too."
"The soup dumplings are simply amazing, and the lo mein, eggplant, and chicken are great. What a meal."
"Joe's Shanghai deserves every bit of it's good reputation for their signature soup dumplings. They are memorable. We also ordered the sesame chicken and the chicken with fried noodles. Both good, but I wish we had experimented more with our selections. We'll just have to go back. We also loved the cozy atmosphere and the friendly service."
"We had eaten at this restaurant in Chinatown and at 56th street when it just opened.  This was our third time at Joe’s.  I have to rate it as the worst meal I have had in New York.   General Chao chicken and pork fried rice were less than mediocre, and the famous dumplings were so-so this time.  The service was horrendous!  The waiter just threw the plates on the table and shoved the dishes.  The waiters were in a hurry to take the dishes away even so the restaurant was half empty.  There was water dripping from the ceiling two tables away from us, but the worst shock were the bathrooms.  The women’s bathroom had a trashcan overflowing with used paper towels and sanitary napkins, and my husband reported fecal matter on the floor of the men’s room.  The stand of the toilet looked like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. Definitely, disgusting!"
Love this one.  Not so much on the midtown version.  Careful not to burn your mouth on the soup dumplings.
too crowded
Soooo Goood! The meanest dumplings ever
buena comida china a precios muy económicos
"We went to Joe's Shanghai upon reviews that the soup dumplings here were the best.  We were so excited to try them, however we were sorely disappointed!!  The soup in the dumpling is not good!  It had some strange flavor that wasn't even edible.  We didn't even finish the whole order.  I kept on trying to give the dumpling another chance and so I tried it without the sauce, and then with the sauce, but it was still the same....NOT good!  We did order the scallion pancakes that were really, really, tasty though.  They were delicious dipped in the sauce that came with them.  

The restaurant was not clean.  The walls had soy sauce & food stains on them.  There were also a lot of servers standing around (we went around 3pm) and instead of standing around I recommend that they scrub the walls instead!  I was afraid to lean against anything when I was eating.  I'm glad that my husband & I didn't wait around to get into this restaurant the night before!  The only reason I can think of why people must like this place is because the prices are really cheap, but I would rather pay more and get a good meal."
"I've tasted better dumplings. The scallion pancakes were burnt. When I sent them back, the waiter went into the kitchen and came right back out with the same pancakes I originally sent back. The hostess was rude and obnxious. Would never go back."
"I've been going to Joe's Shanghai for almost 15 years.  Everytime I visit NYC, I make time for this restaurant.  Stick to the pork dumplings and crab dumplings.  They will not disappoint."
Good food for an amazingly cheap prices.
"I love this dumpling place! Delicious- when visit New York, I always take the time to go to Joe's.  I've had dumplings in China and other authentic Chinese restaurants...and this is one of the best.

You go to this restaurant for the dumplings! Don't waste your time on anything else!  (The other items on the menu are good, a bit overpriced-but good.)"
"The crispy yellow fish, crab dim sums were just excellent. Very cheap treat too. Their service speed is 10 times faster than any standard fast food chain!"
"very attractive dim sums, fish and noodle options with reasonable prices... dont get surprised with the aggressive looking behaviors of the waiters, this is their standard service :)"
"My girlfriend and I went to Joe's for dinner on Black Friday, on the high recommendation from this site, results were disappointing.
While waiting to be seated we saw and assassinated a roach.
Pointed it out to the Hostess, she pointed it out to the Mgr
the roach was still there on departure.
Over all the place looks unkempt will not go there ever again."
Soup dumplings are amazing. Atmosphere is great. Best chinese food i have ever had.
"For the best xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) in NYC, head over to Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown. These tasty morsels will keep you coming back to this hole-in-the-wall where famous not-so regular Joe still takes your order.  $"
Here's Xiaolongbao is very juicy.
"There are better soup dumplings elsewhere in New York, and you don't have to wait in line. The review in the window said it all. The restaurant is only rated two stars. We ordered the pork and the crab soup dumplings. The crab dumplings didn't have much distinction from the pork. It was a disappointment, since we waited 30 minutes in line on a Saturday afternoon, but half of our 8 person party wanted to go somewhere else where we didn't have to wait. We had soup dumplings at Shanghai Cafe, but we returned the next day  to Joe's at 11:00am to beat the lines. It's not worth the wait. Shanghai Cafe is better, and according to New Yorkers there are even better places than both."
DUMPLINGS!!
"If Rickshaw had dumplings like these, I could understand a restaurant dedicated to them."
Cheap and great for their shoronpo the ultra juicy crab dumplings.
Just get the dumplings.   They are excellent.  The other stuff are not worth ordering
Must go every time I'm back in NYC!
The worst service you'll get. But I still wait on line to have a taste at their dumplings. I don't think I have ever eaten anything that I did not like there. A must go.
"Great souop dumplings, everything else not so much"
try the xiao lun bao.
not much choice for veggies except scallion pancakes and fried rice. lol! but those that love chinese food say this is as authentic as it gets and their soup dumplings are the best
It's good enough until you've tried the soup dumplings in Taipei...
dont know about the other dishes but the dumplings are yummm and couldnt get enough of their hot oil paste
soup dumplings great but i prefer shanghai cafe - less crowded and tastier
Food is barely acceptable comparing to real Shanhaiese food. Sorry.
Soup buns a must.
Doesn't live up to the hype. Over-crowded with poor service. Better dumplings at better prices are all around you.
"A ""safe"" choice for eating Chinese in Chinatown. If you prefer more adventurous cuisine try somewhere else."
"Great soup buns yum, crab ones are good at joes."
Cheap and delicious soup dumplings.
Best soup dumplings.
"Totally agree with others -The best soup dumplings (xiao Lung Bao) outside Greater China , other than that...hm...very average...."
Loved their soup dumplings - best outside Greater China
i enjoy their soup dumpling and crispy whole yellowtail.
crab...dumpling...craving...need...
Awesome dumplings!
Best　小龍包（soup bun)！！　Osusume (recommedantion in japanese)!! Cheap and good food.
Have to try their famous pork soup dumplings.
"Two words: SOUP DUMPLINGS!!!!  I come here and order these, they are mouth-watering good!"
haha deeerty but SO GOOD!! haha
SOUP DUMPLINGS>>> Need I say more?
"very cramped and I think its cash only ""haven't been there in a while"" but the sho lon po is the best thats out there"
Delicious shanghai soup dumplings.
flushing location is way better.
"i had the soup dumplings and i have to say they were not good - they tasted like old meat and dishwater - definitely not fresh.  scallion pancakes were good.  the rest was your typical chinese food.  the service as very ""dumpling nazi-ish""."
unique dumpings; sticky and salty however
Even ppl from Shanghai come here for the Crab soup dumplings.  The BEST.
Their dumplings are so juicy and deliciousss...
"soup dumplings cant be matched by anyone else in the east coast, maybe even west coast. fast service, poor ambiance"
great dumplings
i dream of those juicy pockets of joy
"zero ambiance, but who cares...the soup dumplings are great!"
Quick and dirty and very greasy.
Overpriced and the soup dumplings are tastier and cheaper down the street at Goody's.
"Two words: ""Soup dumplings"". Mmmm."
"Love the soup dumplings as well as their drunken chicken and braised fish! Excellent food...although the place is crowded, bustling and possibly in a rush to get you out for the waiting diners to come in."
"great soup dumplings, rest is average."
"So it's kind of annoying that they don't deliver, but those pork soup dumplings will make you pick your butt up and head on over to chinatown. You sit at communal round tables, so be prepared to socialize.  Orange beef, shimp fried rice, chicken and shimp in plum sauce are great choices.  Surprisingly, the sauteed egplant was one of my favorites.  End the meal with a slice of orange. No fortune cookies here..."
Just the dumplings are good.
"good service, presentation, and food quality...however the fame of the joint is overrated, haven't had a Shao-lung-bao that was the greatest amongst the other restaurants, taste pretty much the same and even a little pricier, great for taking friends and co-workers however i'm not loving their price tags, about $1-$3 more than their competitors and it seriously just taste about the same and not any fantastic difference"
"total crowd pleaser. best soup dumplings! and their bok choy and pea shoots are delicious. also love their rice cakes, which aren't what you think--they're these glutinous blobs of tasty goodness. great to go with a bunch of friends. who doesn't love to eat by lazy susan?"
"Not as good as DingTaiFong.. but then again, who is? 
If you're craving soup dumplings, this is a good fix."
dirty place but good food
"I had xiaolongbao for the first time here with friends and so I have warm, fuzzy food memories of this place.  Mmm, xiaolongbao."
Best soup dumplings period.  Get ready to wait in line.
"yummy soup dumplings!!!
open everyday ;)"
Best crab soup dumplings.
The dumpling with soup is great.
Fabulous food if you don't mind the wait.
pork dumplings are an addiction...thanks roger!
too packed to want to go there.
Best Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling)!
Soup Dumplings! Joe's favorite
Best Soup Dumplings in NYC
One word: Delicious
Joe's Shanghai and Joe's Ginger can't be beat for Chinese.
"A little hard to find, but worth the trouble.  We went on a Monday night and the place was packed, but  we had a seat in about 5 min. The waitress was great!! The food is super tasty, and the soy sauce concoction on the table was delicious."
"It was a trek into Chinatown to find this place, but it was definitely worth it! We went on a Saturday for lunch, be prepared for a wait on the weekends. The soup dumplings are the best. We also had the Shanghai noodles...they were excellent but eat them fast before the get cold and too chewy. The scallion pancakes were our favorite. Quick service and they give great recommendations. 

Pros: great food 
Cons: long wait"
"This place has a lot of awards posted on it's window, and the food is delicious.  However, i don't know how authentic it was, considering that all of the clientele is white."
"NYC's chinatown is GREAT. You can find almost anything you want from restaurants serving food from every ethnic region of China to imitation NYPD logo caps. All at a great price. Hidden on one of the side streets is Joe's Shanghai, a must-go restaurant. The minute you enter the restaurant, you will be asked 'how many' steamed dumpling you want, not whether you want it. This is because it is assumed that all customers are there to savour their delicious masterpiece(s). (It is also an efficient method to start steaming them while you continue to look through the menu for other items since they take 10-15 minutes to cook). What makes these steam dumplings superior to all others I have tried is the soup in each dumpling. Hot, savoury and rich tasting, it bursts out of the dumpling as you bite into it. For a split second, you learn to appreciate that something so authentic is available 5000 miles from China. This is their special sauce and I have never tasted better. 

Their variety of soup based noodles are great too. I would recommend going to their original Chinatown location serving with the lowest prices."
"Chinese restaurant of considerable fame that now has a less typical but more hospitable location. Always very good kitchen where the dumplings stand out, really delicious. Very good also the rest. The place is simple but not cold. Average service, but now they speak good English. Please note, you only pay in cash, but they have two ATMs inside. What do you do for the ""cash""..."
"We ended up at their place because the wait at Shanghai 21 was 1 hour. In short, I expected better than our Chinese restaurants in France! A little very disappointed! Waiter who speaks poor English"
"They recommended this Restaurant to us after walking the BROOKLYN Bridge, you have to walk about 20 minutes, but it was worth it for the very delicious food."
"Must try their dim sum, a sensorial experience because they are filled with meat and broth, served with an excellent vinaigrette sauce.
The noodles with good meat, huge portions, at the end bring segments of orange to refresh the mouth. When you arrive they immediately serve fresh water with ice. Kind and professional.
We entered at 7pm on Saturday with practically no queue, but at the exit it was full of people waiting"
"Kind welcome. Efficient service. Obviously, it's difficult to choose when the menu only talks about unknown dishes. So we asked for the same thing as the table next to us (it looked good!). And it was very good. And not expensive ! Well done !"
"In the Chinatown district, there is this authentic restaurant, very simple and basic, but where you can eat well.
Better to anticipate the times a little if you want to avoid queues at the entrance.
The portions are generous and therefore better to share them.
They don't accept credit cards, only cash."
"The soup masses are super delicious.
Full but not overwhelming atmosphere.
Everything well done and correct service."
